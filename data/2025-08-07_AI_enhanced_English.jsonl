We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity.

This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to\ntraditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and\ncomputational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf\nLabel Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down\nMulti-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and\nfew-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these\nstrategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting\nconsistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.\nWhile a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset\nwith a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the\nmachine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase\nsignificantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label\nhierarchies on DH strategy.

In this paper, we revisit\nlogit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:\nTop-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge\nDistillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework\nthat significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two\nmain components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies\nthe most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers\ntargeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into\nexisting KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring\narchitectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,\nand Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates\nsubstantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its\nversatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the\nsignificant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces TopKD, a logit-based knowledge distillation method focusing on Top-K knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.", "motivation": "Existing knowledge distillation methods often overlook critical information in teacher logit distributions, particularly Top-K knowledge.", "method": "Proposes TopKD with two components: Top-K Scaling Module (TSM) to amplify informative logits and Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL) for targeted supervision.", "result": "TopKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet, and works well with Vision Transformers.", "conclusion": "Logits hold significant potential for advancing knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by TopKD's effectiveness and versatility."}}

BEV\nperception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding\nenvironment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and\ntrajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on\nenhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored\npotential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two\ncontrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining\nBEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image\nbackbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses\nleads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the\nbackbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon\nachieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement\nover state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of\nrepresentation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to\nconventional task-specific optimizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "BEVCon is a contrastive learning framework for improving BEV perception in autonomous driving, enhancing feature representations and achieving +2.4% mAP gain.", "motivation": "Addressing the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models, which is crucial for tasks like 3D object detection and segmentation.", "method": "Introduces two contrastive learning modules: instance feature contrast for BEV features and perspective view contrast for the image backbone, combined with detection losses.", "result": "Achieves up to +2.4% mAP improvement on the nuScenes dataset over state-of-the-art baselines.", "conclusion": "Highlights the importance of representation learning in BEV perception and offers a complementary approach to task-specific optimizations."}}

Project website:\n  https://matthew-leng.github.io/stocc", "summary": "3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous\ndriving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,\nit remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across\nmultiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and\ndynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level\noccupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the\nspatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core\ndesigns: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical\ninformation and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and\na memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the\nspatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D\noccupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between\nmulti-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Occ is a framework for 3D occupancy representation learning in autonomous driving, improving spatiotemporal feature learning with temporal consistency.", "motivation": "Challenges in efficiently aggregating 3D occupancy over time due to high processing costs and voxel uncertainty/dynamics.", "method": "Uses a spatiotemporal memory for historical info and memory attention for uncertainty/dynamic awareness.", "result": "Outperforms state-of-the-art by 3 mIoU, reduces temporal inconsistency by 29%.", "conclusion": "ST-Occ effectively enhances 3D occupancy prediction by leveraging temporal dependencies."}}
