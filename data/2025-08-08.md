### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual, a Retinex-based framework for Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration, outperforms traditional methods by combining Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA) to address reflectance and illumination distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UHD IR methods like downsampling or frequency-domain transformations suffer from irreversible information loss or ineffective artifact handling, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: RetinexDual uses two sub-networks: SAMBA for reflectance correction via coarse-to-fine modeling and FIA for frequency-domain illumination and color correction.

Result: RetinexDual excels in deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement, surpassing recent methods in quality and metrics.

Conclusion: RetinexDual's dual-branch design and component effectiveness validate its superiority in UHD IR tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENTRep introduces a grand challenge for ENT endoscopy analysis, combining fine-grained classification and retrieval tasks with bilingual clinical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ENT care lacks robust automated analysis tools due to device/operator variability and subtle findings. Existing benchmarks rarely support retrieval needs.

Method: The dataset includes expert-annotated images with anatomical labels, status, and bilingual descriptions. Three benchmark tasks are defined, with standardized evaluation.

Result: Performance is evaluated on public/private splits, with top team results reported.

Conclusion: ENTRep addresses gaps in ENT analysis, offering a standardized framework for future research.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD unifies knowledge from multiple self-supervised Vision Transformers into a compact student network using asymmetric masking and consensus gating, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods are pretrained in isolation, missing complementary insights and creating impractical large models for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: CoMAD distills knowledge from three ViT-Base teachers (MAE, MoCo v3, iBOT) using asymmetric masking, linear adapters, and joint consensus gating. The student is trained with dual-level KL divergence.

Result: CoMAD's ViT-Tiny achieves 75.4% Top-1 on ImageNet-1K, 47.3% mIoU on ADE20K, and 44.5%/40.5% AP on MS-COCO, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoMAD effectively unifies diverse self-supervised insights into a compact model, outperforming prior methods in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR introduces a reconstruction-free, attention-based diffusion model for real-time anomaly detection, outperforming SOTA methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods are computationally expensive, prone to errors with complex patterns, and require prior knowledge of anomalies.

Method: RADAR directly generates anomaly maps from diffusion models without reconstruction, improving speed and accuracy.

Result: RADAR achieves 7% higher F1 score on MVTec-AD and 13% on 3D-printed material datasets compared to SOTA models.

Conclusion: RADAR offers a superior, efficient alternative to reconstruction-based anomaly detection, validated by significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective deep learning method using event cameras to track eye movements, achieving 81% accuracy with a CNN_LSTM model, and suggests future improvements with LRP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate eye tracking is challenging due to rapid eye movements and expensive equipment. The goal is to develop an affordable, interpretable algorithm for applications in VR/AR.

Method: The study uses a CNN_LSTM model to predict eye center positions from event camera inputs.

Result: The CNN_LSTM model achieved approximately 81% accuracy in tracking eye movements.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for cost-effective eye tracking, with future work planned to enhance interpretability and performance using LRP.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN is a model for 3D human motion prediction using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Lucas polynomial activations, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D human motion prediction.

Method: LuKAN uses discrete wavelet transform for temporal encoding, spatial projection for joint dependencies, and a KAN layer with Lucas polynomials for efficient function approximation.

Result: LuKAN shows competitive performance on benchmark datasets, with both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LuKAN effectively addresses the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in 3D human motion prediction.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench evaluates MLLMs' ability to identify subtle visual clues and integrate them with world knowledge for complex reasoning, revealing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on subtle visual details critical for deep reasoning, prompting the need for VER-Bench.

Method: VER-Bench uses 374 questions across six reasoning types, each with structured evidence (visual clues and reasoning).

Result: Current models struggle with extracting and reasoning from subtle visual evidence.

Conclusion: Enhancing models' fine-grained visual evidence extraction and reasoning is essential for genuine visual understanding.

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM introduces multi-modal queries and dual-stream attention to improve transformer-based object detection, addressing occlusion, localization, and efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based detectors struggle with occlusions, fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency due to fixed queries and dense attention.

Method: DAMM uses appearance-based, positional, and random learned queries, along with a dual-stream cross-attention module for refining semantic and spatial features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in AP and recall on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAMM's multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention effectively enhance accuracy and efficiency in object detection.

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of label ambiguity in hateful video detection by analyzing fine-grained, timestamp-annotated segments, revealing how coarse annotations introduce noise and affect model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of hate speech in online videos is a critical issue, but existing detection methods rely on coarse annotations, leading to label noise and reduced accuracy.

Method: Trim hateful videos using annotated timestamps to isolate hateful segments, analyze their distribution, and conduct controlled experiments to assess label noise impact.

Result: Coarse annotations introduce semantic overlap and confusion, altering model decision boundaries and weakening classification confidence.

Conclusion: Temporally aware models and benchmarks are needed for robust and interpretable hate speech detection in videos.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that dynamically adapts to each test video's unique characteristics, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use generic models for all test videos, failing to adapt to individual variations, which reduces highlight detection performance.

Method: Highlight-TTA dynamically adapts models during testing using an auxiliary task (cross-modality hallucinations) and meta-auxiliary training.

Result: Experiments show Highlight-TTA improves performance of three state-of-the-art models across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA enhances generalization and performance in video highlight detection by adapting to test videos' unique characteristics.

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to adapt monocular depth estimators (FMDEs) for fisheye images using calibration tokens, avoiding retraining and improving depth estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs trained on perspective images perform poorly on fisheye images due to covariate shift from camera calibration differences.

Method: Aligns latent embeddings of fisheye images to perspective images using calibration tokens, leveraging existing FMDEs without retraining.

Result: Consistently improves depth estimation accuracy on fisheye images for both indoor and outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts FMDEs for fisheye cameras, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches without additional training data.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

*Bo Deng,Levi Heath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feedforward neural network trained on ImageNet 2012 achieves 98.3% accuracy, with 99.69 Top-1 rate, using a new method. The model has 322M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve image classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset using a novel training method.

Method: Feedforward artificial neural network trained with a new method on ImageNet 2012 dataset.

Result: Achieved 98.3% accuracy, 99.69 Top-1 rate, and 285.9 perfectly classified labels per batch.

Conclusion: High accuracy is achieved, but double-labeling issues may prevent 100% accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM enhances vision-language models by integrating masked image modeling into prompt learning, improving generalization without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories.

Method: ProMIM integrates masked image modeling (MIM) into VLM pipelines, using a masking strategy to generate instance-conditioned prompts.

Result: ProMIM improves feature robustness and generalization in zero-shot and few-shot tasks without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProMIM offers a lightweight, effective solution for enhancing vision-language models' adaptability and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRKT improves weakly supervised dynamic scene graph generation by enhancing object detection with relation- and motion-aware knowledge, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WS-DSGG methods rely on external object detectors that perform poorly in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios, leading to inaccurate results.

Method: TRKT uses relation-aware knowledge mining (highlighting object and interactive areas) and a dual-stream fusion module to refine object detection.

Result: TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Action Genome dataset.

Conclusion: TRKT effectively addresses the limitations of external detectors in WS-DSGG, improving accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

### [15] [AdvDINO: Domain-Adversarial Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Spatial Proteomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04955)
*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvDINO is a domain-adversarial SSL framework that enhances domain-invariant feature learning, tested on lung cancer mIF images, improving robustness and biological relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing domain shift in SSL, especially critical in biomedical imaging where batch effects obscure biological signals.

Method: Integrates a gradient reversal layer into DINOv2 to promote domain-invariant features, applied to mIF images.

Result: Mitigates slide-specific biases, uncovers phenotype clusters with prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction.

Conclusion: AdvDINO is broadly applicable to imaging domains with domain shift and limited annotations, enhancing generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg is a human-in-the-loop framework for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse annotations and hierarchical prototype disambiguation to achieve high-quality segmentation for base and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-world point cloud semantic segmentation rely on resource-intensive offline learning or densely annotated data, limiting practicality. HOW-Seg addresses these limitations by incorporating human feedback.

Method: HOW-Seg constructs class prototypes directly on query data to avoid bias, uses sparse human annotations for guidance, refines prototypes with a hierarchical disambiguation mechanism, and employs a dense CRF for label optimization.

Result: HOW-Seg matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods with sparse annotations (e.g., one-click per novel class) and achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2 with denser annotations.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg demonstrates the effectiveness of human-in-the-loop frameworks for open-world point cloud segmentation, outperforming alternatives with minimal human input.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

### [17] [UGOD: Uncertainty-Guided Differentiable Opacity and Soft Dropout for Enhanced Sparse-View 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04968)
*Zhihao Guo,Peng Wang,Zidong Chen,Xiangyu Kong,Yan Lyu,Guanyu Gao,Liangxiu Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive weighting method for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve rendering quality in sparse-view scenarios by using learned uncertainties for opacity updates and soft dropout regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods treat Gaussians equally, leading to overfitting, especially in sparse-view settings. The paper aims to address this by leveraging learned uncertainties for adaptive weighting.

Method: The proposed method uses learned uncertainties to guide Gaussian opacity updates and applies soft differentiable dropout regularization to transform uncertainties into drop probabilities for rendering.

Result: The method outperforms competitors in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians, e.g., a 3.27% PSNR improvement over DropGaussian on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Conclusion: Adaptive weighting via learned uncertainties enhances 3DGS rendering quality, particularly in sparse-view scenarios, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends canvas-based attention scheduling for real-time object detection on edge platforms, introducing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of executing high-resolution object detection under strict latency constraints on limited computing resources.

Method: Extends prior work by allowing variable-size canvas frames and selectable frame rates, evaluated using YOLOv11 on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with Waymo Open Dataset.

Result: Improves quality/cost trade-offs, achieving higher mean average precision (mAP) and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements to canvas-based attention scheduling enable better performance in real-time perception tasks on edge platforms.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

*Zheng Chen,Mingde Zhou,Jinpei Guo,Jiale Yuan,Yifei Ji,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODEC is a single-step diffusion image compression model addressing latency and fidelity issues in diffusion-based methods by using informative latents and a fidelity guidance module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image compression suffers from high decoding latency and poor fidelity due to multi-step sampling and reliance on generative priors.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained VAE for rich latent information, replaces iterative denoising with single-step decoding, and introduces fidelity guidance and rate annealing training.

Result: SODEC outperforms existing methods in rate-distortion-perception performance and improves decoding speed by over 20x.

Conclusion: SODEC effectively addresses the drawbacks of diffusion-based compression, offering faster and higher-fidelity results.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

*Shenglun Chen,Xinzhu Ma,Hong Zhang,Haojie Li,Zhihui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel depth completion framework leverages depth foundation models for robustness without large-scale training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models degrade in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios due to limited training data. Foundation models offer robustness potential.

Method: Uses a depth foundation model for environmental cues, dual-space propagation (3D/2D), and a learnable correction module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 16 OOD datasets, demonstrating remarkable robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances depth completion robustness without extensive training, validated by superior OOD performance.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

*Xinyao Li,Jingjing Li,Zhekai Du,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified modality separation framework to address the modality gap in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using vision-language models (VLMs), improving target performance by disentangling and handling modality-specific and invariant components separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap in VLMs limits the effectiveness of direct UDA, as it only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to suboptimal performance. The paper aims to overcome this by leveraging both modality-specific and invariant components.

Method: Proposes a framework that disentangles modality components from VLM features, handles them separately, and uses modality-adaptive ensemble weights at test time. A modality discrepancy metric categorizes samples to guide alignment and annotation.

Result: Achieves up to 9% performance gain with 9 times computational efficiency, validated across various backbones, datasets, and adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the modality gap in UDA, enhancing cross-modal alignment and model performance through a unified approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

### [22] [Modeling Rapid Contextual Learning in the Visual Cortex with Fast-Weight Deep Autoencoder Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04988)
*Yue Li,Weifan Wang,Tai Sing Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how familiarity training in a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder induces global context sensitivity in early layers, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fast weights. Results show manifold transformations, alignment of latent representations, and broader self-attention scope, suggesting a hybrid fast-and-slow weight model for rapid learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context in early layers of deep neural networks, inspired by neurophysiological findings on rapid learning in the early visual cortex.

Method: A ViT-based autoencoder is used, incorporating LoRA for fast weights, to simulate and analyze the effects of familiarity training on self-attention and latent representations.

Result: Familiarity training aligns early-layer representations with global context, broadens self-attention scope, and these effects are amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.

Conclusion: Familiarity training enhances global sensitivity in early layers, and a hybrid fast-and-slow weight architecture may model rapid context learning in the brain.

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

*Rui Zhi,Zhen Yang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-ReID is a novel framework for occluded person re-identification, leveraging pre-trained models to extract fine-grained attributes without extra data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained vision-language models struggle with occluded Re-ID by neglecting fine-grained attributes, limiting performance in partial occlusion or subtle appearance cases.

Method: AG-ReID uses a two-stage process: generating attribute pseudo-labels and a dual-guidance mechanism combining holistic and fine-grained attributes for feature extraction.

Result: AG-ReID outperforms existing methods on occluded Re-ID datasets, handling occlusions and subtle differences effectively while maintaining standard Re-ID performance.

Conclusion: AG-ReID addresses limitations of pre-trained models in occluded Re-ID, offering a robust solution with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRAM, a method for video continual learning using compressed vision to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory demands of video continual learning, especially with long videos, by using compressed representations.

Method: Proposes CRAM, which stores video codes (embeddings) instead of raw data, refreshes codes to combat forgetting, and trains a classifier via IID sampling.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on large-scale benchmarks (EpicKitchens-100, Kinetics-700) with under 2 GB memory usage.

Conclusion: CRAM effectively reduces memory footprint in video continual learning while improving performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDRL integrates causal inference with VLMs to improve domain generalization in medical image segmentation by addressing confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP struggle with medical imaging due to domain shifts caused by confounders, leading to poor generalization.

Method: MCDRL uses CLIP to identify lesion regions and build a confounder dictionary, then trains a causal intervention network to eliminate domain-specific variations.

Result: MCDRL outperforms other methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robust generalizability.

Conclusion: MCDRL effectively addresses domain shifts in medical imaging, enhancing segmentation performance and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Motivation: The lack of specialized quality assessment models for AI-enhanced UGC limits user experience and hinders advancement in image enhancement techniques.

Method: Constructed AU-IQA, a dataset of 4,800 AI-UGC images from three enhancement types (super-resolution, low-light enhancement, denoising), and evaluated traditional IQA and multimodal models.

Result: Evaluated existing models on AU-IQA, providing insights into their effectiveness for AI-UGC quality assessment.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved quality assessment models tailored to AI-UGC and provides a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

TL;DR: A weakly supervised framework, skin-SOAP, generates structured SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing manual effort and clinician burnout while matching performance of advanced models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin carcinoma is highly prevalent and costly, requiring efficient, accurate documentation to improve patient care and reduce clinician workload.

Method: Proposes skin-SOAP, a multimodal framework using limited inputs (images and text) with weak supervision to generate SOAP notes, minimizing manual annotations.

Result: Matches performance of GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, validated by novel metrics MedConceptEval and CCS.

Conclusion: skin-SOAP offers scalable, clinically relevant documentation, reducing clinician burden and reliance on large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new metric, SCSSIM, evaluates image quality by preserving Scene Composition Structure (SCS) without training, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to assess SCS integrity, crucial for accurate generative AI outputs.

Method: SCSSIM uses Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning to quantify SCS preservation analytically.

Result: SCSSIM is robust to non-compositional distortions and sensitive to compositional changes, outperforming other metrics.

Conclusion: SCSSIM is a superior, training-free tool for evaluating generative models' structural fidelity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HAMoBE, a novel framework for video-based person re-identification, leveraging multi-layer features from a pre-trained model and adaptive expert integration for improved matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based ReID methods lack focus on selecting discriminative features for effective matching in dynamic environments.

Method: HAMoBE uses a hierarchical approach with two levels: low-level feature extraction and specialized experts for long-term, short-term, and temporal features, dynamically adjusted by a dual-input decision gating network.

Result: HAMoBE achieves significant improvements, e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy on benchmarks like MEVID.

Conclusion: The proposed HAMoBE framework effectively addresses feature selection and integration challenges in video-based ReID, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Conclusion: The work highlights MLLMs' limitations in fine-grained tasks and demonstrates Spot-IT's effectiveness in improving performance.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

*Yifeng Huang,Zhang Chen,Yi Xu,Minh Hoai,Zhong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualMat is a dual-path diffusion framework for PBR material estimation from single images, using albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths with feature distillation and rectified flow for efficiency. It excels in performance, especially in albedo and metallic-roughness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately estimate PBR materials from single images under complex lighting, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Uses two latent spaces (albedo-optimized and material-specialized) with feature distillation and rectified flow. Supports high-resolution and multi-view inputs via patch-based estimation and cross-view attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 28% better albedo estimation and 39% lower metallic-roughness errors than existing methods.

Conclusion: DualMat is highly effective for PBR material estimation, with superior performance and practical integration into image-to-3D pipelines.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS is a two-stage framework for Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) that decouples class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation, improving retention-plasticity balance and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in CSS by reducing interference between old and new class learning, which is a limitation of single-stage encoder-decoder architectures.

Method: Uses a two-stage approach: (1) class-aware detection with pre-trained encoders and LoRA adaptation, (2) class-agnostic segmentation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Result: DecoupleCSS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively balancing retention of past knowledge and learning of new classes.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach in DecoupleCSS significantly improves CSS performance, offering a robust solution to catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

*Ruiyu Li,Changyuan Qiu,Hangrui Cao,Qihan Ren,Yuqing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning, addressing the ill-posed nature of the task by leveraging scene semantics and texture cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image colorization is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, but semantics and texture provide useful color cues. The goal is to improve colorization by moving beyond regression to classification and adversarial learning.

Method: The approach involves building models based on prior works, modifying them for specific scenarios, and comparing results. Classification and adversarial learning are key techniques.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the focus is on improving colorization accuracy by addressing multi-modal color prediction.

Conclusion: The paper aims to advance image colorization by leveraging classification and adversarial learning, building on existing methods and adapting them for better performance.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

*Jian Zhu,Shanyuan Liu,Liuzhuozheng Li,Yue Gong,He Wang,Bo Cheng,Yuhang Ma,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup is a novel makeup transfer framework that eliminates auxiliary face-control components, leveraging source-reference pairs and a lightweight injector for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN and diffusion-based methods rely on auxiliary components, introducing errors and suboptimal results. FLUX-Makeup aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Built on FLUX-Kontext, it uses source images as conditional input and introduces RefLoRAInjector for efficient makeup feature extraction. A robust data generation pipeline enhances training.

Result: FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing methods by eliminating auxiliary components and leveraging superior data generation.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

*Yuxiang Xiao,Yang Hu,Bin Li,Tianyang Zhang,Zexi Li,Huazhu Fu,Jens Rittscher,Kaixiang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaFusion is a prompt-guided framework that dynamically integrates multiple pathology foundation models (PFMs) to address latent biases and improve generalizability and interpretability in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs exhibit latent biases due to diverse pretraining contexts, limiting their generalizability and transparency in applications.

Method: AdaFusion compresses and aligns tile-level features from multiple PFMs, using a lightweight attention mechanism for adaptive fusion based on tissue phenotype context.

Result: AdaFusion outperforms individual PFMs in tasks like treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference, while providing interpretable insights.

Conclusion: AdaFusion effectively bridges heterogeneous PFMs, enhancing performance and interpretability by addressing model-specific biases.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

*Jingxuan He,Busheng Su,Finn Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGen is a novel framework for generating long, identity-preserving videos from a single image and pose sequence, using in-context LoRA finetuning and interleaved segment generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with identity drift and short clip limitations, making long, coherent video generation challenging.

Method: PoseGen uses in-context LoRA finetuning for identity preservation and pose conditioning, along with interleaved segment generation for unlimited duration.

Result: PoseGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and produces artifact-free, unlimited-duration videos.

Conclusion: PoseGen addresses key challenges in video generation, offering superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty) improves Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) by integrating margin penalties strategically, balancing base-class discriminability and new-class generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in incremental tasks due to data privacy and high acquisition costs, and improve forward compatibility in FSCIL.

Method: Proposes SMP with Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) for base task learning and Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) for incremental tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200, balancing base and new classes effectively.

Conclusion: SMP is a promising solution for FSCIL, addressing key challenges in forward compatibility and decision boundary refinement.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

*Jiuyang Dong,Jiahan Li,Junjun Jiang,Kui Jiang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHDMIL is a framework for fast and accurate pathological image classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs in multi-instance learning (MIL) for pathological image classification due to processing thousands of patches per gigapixel image.

Method: Two-step training: self-distillation (SD) for patch relevance scoring and asymmetric distillation (AD) for lightweight pre-screening. Uses DMIN and DB-LIPN networks, plus a CKA classifier.

Result: Achieves 5.3% accuracy improvement and 1.2x speedup on Camelyon16; consistent gains in AUC, accuracy, F1, and Brier scores across datasets.

Conclusion: AHDMIL is effective for efficient and accurate pathological image classification, with significant performance and speed improvements.

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual grounding framework uses multiple latent expressions from a single text input to improve object localization by incorporating missing visual details, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on sparse textual cues, missing rich visual details, leading to misidentification of similar objects.

Method: Introduces subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts, along with positive-margin contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC methods and excels in GRES benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between sparse text and rich visuals, enhancing localization accuracy.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

TL;DR: FedGIN is a Federated Learning framework for multimodal organ segmentation, addressing data scarcity and privacy issues with a GIN augmentation module. It improves performance significantly in limited and complete dataset scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, data-driven clinical decision-making across diverse imaging modalities without sharing raw patient data.

Method: Proposes FedGIN, integrating a GIN augmentation module to harmonize modality-specific intensity distributions in Federated Learning.

Result: Achieves 12-18% improvement in limited-data scenarios and near-centralized performance in complete datasets, with strong cross-modality generalization.

Conclusion: FedGIN effectively addresses challenges in multimodal medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, improving performance and generalization.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for automatically discovering chronic pain-related features in mice, outperforming human experts and existing methods in classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing chronic pain in mice rely on manual labeling, which may introduce bias and lack accuracy in capturing persistent behavioral changes.

Method: Uses a universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse action features from video data, avoiding human labeling bias.

Result: Achieves 48.41% accuracy in 15-class pain classification (vs. 21.33% for humans, 30.52% for B-SOiD) and 73.1% in simplified 3-class classification. Validated with drug efficacy testing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates clinical potential for pain research and drug development by providing unbiased, automated behavioral analysis.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a rotation-equivariant ASISR method to address artifacts in arbitrary-scale image super-resolution by redesigning INR and encoder modules for better geometric pattern recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of warped and deformed geometric patterns in low-resolution images, which leads to artifacts in high-resolution recoveries, by embedding rotation equivariance into ASISR networks.

Method: Redesigns the INR and encoder modules to incorporate rotation equivariance, enabling end-to-end rotational equivariance from input to output. Theoretical analysis of equivariance error is provided.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real datasets show superiority, and the method can be integrated into existing ASISR frameworks to enhance performance.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation-equivariant ASISR method effectively maintains structural integrity and improves recovery quality, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model human and animal motion separately, lacking a unified approach. Morphological differences across species compromise motion plausibility, necessitating a joint solution.

Method: X-MoGen uses a two-stage architecture: a conditional graph variational autoencoder for T-pose priors and an autoencoder for motion encoding, regularized by morphological loss. Masked motion modeling generates motion embeddings from text.

Result: X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seen and unseen species, validated on the UniMo4D dataset.

Conclusion: X-MoGen successfully unifies human and animal motion generation, improving generalization and plausibility through a shared framework and dataset.

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Result: PhysPatch outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems and ensures physically feasible patch placement.

Conclusion: PhysPatch enhances attack effectiveness and real-world deployability for MLLM-based AD systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

### [45] [Multi-tracklet Tracking for Generic Targets with Adaptive Detection Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05172)
*Zewei Wu,Longhao Wang,Cui Wang,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) to handle unseen categories in multitarget tracking by integrating tracklet generation and association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen categories due to low-confidence detections, weak constraints, and occlusions.

Method: Adaptively clusters detections into tracklets, then estimates partitions using location and appearance clues to reduce long-term errors.

Result: Demonstrates competitiveness on benchmark tests for generic multiple object tracking.

Conclusion: MTT effectively addresses challenges in tracking unseen categories.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

### [46] [MELLA: Bridging Linguistic Capability and Cultural Groundedness for Low-Resource Language MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05502)
*Yufei Gao,Jiaying Fei,Nuo Chen,Ruirui Chen,Guohang Yan,Yunshi Lan,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-resource languages by proposing a dual-source strategy for data collection, focusing on linguistic capability and cultural groundedness. The introduced dataset, MELLA, improves model performance across eight languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual enhancement methods for MLLMs are limited to text or machine translation, neglecting multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, which are crucial for low-resource languages.

Method: A dual-source strategy is proposed: native web alt-text for cultural groundedness and MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability. The dataset MELLA is introduced as an implementation.

Result: Fine-tuning on MELLA improves performance across eight languages, with models producing richer "thick descriptions". Gains are attributed to enhanced cultural knowledge and linguistic capability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of cultural awareness in MLLMs for low-resource languages and demonstrates the effectiveness of the dual-source strategy through MELLA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

### [47] [SPA++: Generalized Graph Spectral Alignment for Versatile Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05182)
*Zhiqing Xiao,Haobo Wang,Xu Lu,Wentao Ye,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPA++ is a graph spectral alignment framework for domain adaptation, combining coarse graph alignment, spectral regularization, and neighbor-aware propagation to improve discriminability and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior domain adaptation methods focus on inter-domain transferability but neglect intra-domain structures, harming discriminability. SPA++ addresses this tradeoff.

Method: SPA++ uses graph primitives for coarse alignment, spectral regularization, and neighbor-aware propagation, with data augmentation and consistency regularization for robustness.

Result: SPA++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmark datasets, showing superior robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: SPA++ effectively balances transferability and discriminability, with theoretical support and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-CoT is a unified Chain-of-Thought framework for multimodal reasoning, combining image understanding and generation to model visual state transitions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending CoT reasoning to vision-language tasks is challenging due to difficulties in modeling visual state transitions and fragmented architectures.

Method: Uni-CoT introduces a two-level reasoning paradigm (Macro-Level CoT for task planning and Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution) and a structured training paradigm with interleaved supervision.

Result: Uni-CoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning-driven image generation and editing benchmarks (WISE, RISE, KRIS) with efficient computation (8 A100 GPUs).

Conclusion: Uni-CoT is a scalable and coherent solution for multimodal reasoning, demonstrating strong generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPEX is a multimodal LLM for land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing, leveraging spectral priors encoded in the SPIE dataset and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral information is underutilized in vision-language models for remote sensing, leading to suboptimal performance in multispectral scenarios.

Method: Constructs SPIE dataset with spectral priors, proposes SPEX with multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five public datasets for land cover extraction and provides textual explanations.

Conclusion: SPEX advances spectral remote sensing by integrating spectral priors and LLMs, offering precise, interpretable land cover extraction.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

### [50] [Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for GUI Grounding via Region Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05615)
*Yong Du,Yuchen Yan,Fei Tang,Zhengxi Lu,Chang Zong,Weiming Lu,Shengpei Jiang,Yongliang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO improve GUI grounding accuracy by leveraging spatial overlap patterns and test-time reinforcement learning, achieving 2-3% gains without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding methods rely on costly pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. The paper aims to exploit implicit confidence signals from spatial overlap for more accurate localization.

Method: Proposes GUI-RC (spatial voting grids for consensus regions) and GUI-RCPO (consistency-based rewards for test-time reinforcement learning).

Result: GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% on ScreenSpot benchmarks; GUI-RCPO further boosts performance (e.g., 80.11% to 85.14% for Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of test-time scaling and reinforcement learning for robust, data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [51] [EndoMatcher: Generalizable Endoscopic Image Matcher via Multi-Domain Pre-training for Robot-Assisted Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05205)
*Bingyu Yang,Qingyao Tian,Yimeng Geng,Huai Liao,Xinyan Huang,Jiebo Luo,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoMatcher is a generalizable endoscopic image matcher using large-scale, multi-domain pre-training and a two-branch Vision Transformer for robust feature matching under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense feature matching in endoscopic images is essential for robot-assisted tasks but is hindered by difficult visual conditions and lack of annotated data.

Method: EndoMatcher uses a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks and is trained on Endo-Mix6, a multi-domain dataset of 1.2M image pairs, using a progressive multi-objective strategy.

Result: EndoMatcher improves inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on Hamlyn and Bladder datasets and boosts MDPA by 9.40% on Gastro-Matching.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher achieves accurate, dense matching in challenging endoscopic conditions and generalizes well to unseen domains.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

### [52] [VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information Flow-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05211)
*Sihan Yang,Runsen Xu,Chenhang Cui,Tai Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFlowOpt is a token pruning framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that reduces computational costs by pruning 90% of visual tokens while maintaining performance, achieving faster inference and lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token pruning methods in LMMs are simplistic and cause performance degradation, highlighting the need for a more refined approach.

Method: VFlowOpt introduces an importance map based on attention-derived context relevance and patch-level entropy, a progressive pruning module with recycling, and optimizes pruning strategies using visual information flow.

Result: The framework prunes 90% of visual tokens with minimal performance loss, reducing KV-Cache memory by 89% and speeding up inference by 3.8x.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt offers an effective solution for token pruning in LMMs, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

*Jianming Liu,Wenlong Qiu,Haitao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a source-free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) method using textual and visual information for target domain adaptation without source data, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in Few-Shot Segmentation due to domain discrepancies and privacy/data transfer concerns by enabling source-free adaptation.

Method: Uses Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) and alignment modules (VVEA, TVEA) to adapt pre-trained backbone features to target tasks without source data.

Result: Achieves average accuracy improvements of 2.18% (1-shot) and 4.11% (5-shot) across four datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed source-free CD-FSS method effectively leverages multi-modal information for cross-domain adaptation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reasoning-based vision-language tracking framework, ReasoningTrack, is proposed, leveraging pre-trained model Qwen2.5-VL and optimized with SFT and GRPO. It introduces a new dataset TNLLT and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods lack flexibility and reasoning insights, limiting performance. This paper aims to improve tracking by integrating reasoning and language generation.

Method: Uses Qwen2.5-VL, optimizes with SFT and GRPO, embeds updated language descriptions, and combines with vision features in a unified backbone network. Introduces TNLLT dataset.

Result: Outperforms baselines on multiple datasets, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack effectively enhances vision-language tracking by integrating reasoning and language generation, supported by the new TNLLT dataset.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

TL;DR: A fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM v2.1) effectively segments irregular gas bubbles in multiphase flows using minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to segment deformed or coalesced bubbles, limiting industrial applications like metallurgy and maritime drag reduction.

Method: Transfer learning with SAM v2.1, fine-tuned on just 100 annotated images, addresses the challenge of non-convex bubble structures.

Result: SAM v2.1 accurately segments highly irregular bubbles, outperforming traditional and recent learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of vision foundation models for complex bubble segmentation in industrial settings.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen is a diffusion-based framework for generating controllable camera images from arbitrary viewpoints, using Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching (FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL) to address the lack of ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating high-fidelity images from arbitrary viewpoints in autonomous driving due to missing ground-truth data for extrapolated views.

Method: Uses FAVS for hierarchical matching and fine-grained alignment, and CVC-SSL for self-supervised cross-view consistency training with a diffusion model.

Result: Generates controllable arbitrary-view camera images without needing additional sensors or depth maps.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen is the first method for controllable arbitrary-view image generation in multiple vehicle configurations.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing adversarial robustness with zero-shot generalization in VLMs like CLIP.

Method: Analyzes two defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT) and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, reviewing methods like TeCoA, LAAT, TIMA, AOM, TTC, and CLIPure.

Result: Highlights the progression from alignment-preserving techniques to embedding space re-engineering and latent-space purification.

Conclusion: Identifies future directions, including hybrid defenses and adversarial pre-training, to enhance robustness without compromising generalization.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial

this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial

Motivation: The challenges of limited annotated medical data and overreliance on global image features, which miss subtle pathological regions, motivate the development of RegionMed-CLIP.

Method: The framework uses an ROI processor to integrate fine-grained regional features with global context, supported by progressive training and hierarchical multimodal alignment. It leverages MedRegion-500k, a large annotated medical image-text corpus.

Result: RegionMed-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language models in tasks like image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Region-aware contrastive pre-training is critical for medical image understanding, and RegionMed-CLIP serves as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical applications.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

### [59] [A Study of Gender Classification Techniques Based on Iris Images: A Deep Survey and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05246)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A review of gender classification methods, focusing on facial and iris biometrics, highlighting gaps and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification is useful in applications like surveillance and human-computer interaction, with iris and facial features being prominent biometric traits.

Method: Review of existing literature and methodologies for gender classification, emphasizing facial and iris-based approaches.

Result: Identifies gaps and challenges in current methods, providing insights for future research.

Conclusion: The study offers a comprehensive analysis of gender classification techniques, suggesting future improvements for researchers.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

*Hyunjoon Lee,Joonkyu Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CF3 proposes a top-down pipeline for efficient 3D Gaussian feature fields, reducing computational costs by 95% compared to Feature-3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods rely on costly bottom-up optimization of raw 2D features.

Method: Uses weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians, trains per-Gaussian autoencoders, and applies adaptive sparsification to prune redundant Gaussians.

Result: Achieves competitive 3D feature fields with only 5% of the Gaussians used in Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: CF3 offers a compact, fast, and efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

*Suresh Guttikonda,Maximilian Neidhart,Johanna Sprenger,Johannes Petersen,Christian Detter,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks is proposed for robust intraoperative cardiac imaging, outperforming deep learning and conventional trackers in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods struggle with heart motion and image fluctuations during coronary bypass grafting surgery, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed method uses particle filtering with cyclic-consistency checks to track 117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps.

Result: Achieves a tracking error of 5.00 +/- 0.22 px, significantly better than deep learning (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

Conclusion: The method enables real-time, accurate cardiac perfusion estimation during interventions, improving surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional
trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

### [62] [SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264)
*Xiaoyang Zhang,Zhen Hua,Yakun Ju,Wei Zhou,Jun Liu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse is a conditional diffusion model guided by SAM for high-fidelity, semantically-aware infrared and visible image fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods lack deep semantic understanding, causing key target loss and artifacts. SGDFuse addresses this by leveraging SAM's semantic masks.

Method: Uses SAM's semantic masks as priors in a two-stage process: preliminary fusion followed by diffusion model-guided refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in subjective/objective evaluations and downstream task adaptability.

Conclusion: SGDFuse effectively solves core IVIF challenges with high-fidelity, semantic-aware fusion.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces B4DL, a benchmark for training and evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on 4D LiDAR data, addressing the lack of high-quality annotations and suitable architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D LiDAR data is underutilized in MLLMs due to missing annotations and processing capabilities, despite its potential for dynamic outdoor scene understanding.

Method: The authors propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that directly processes raw 4D LiDAR data, integrating it with language understanding.

Result: The benchmark and model provide a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments, supported by rendered 4D LiDAR videos and datasets.

Conclusion: B4DL and the proposed model advance 4D LiDAR understanding in MLLMs, offering tools for improved dynamic scene analysis.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

### [64] [Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding for Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05271)
*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes WGDF, a wavelet-guided method for remote sensing change detection, enhancing edge and fine-grained change detection by leveraging frequency-domain features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on spatial-domain modeling, limiting feature diversity and hindering detection of subtle changes. Frequency-domain modeling, especially in the wavelet domain, can better capture fine-grained differences.

Method: WGDF uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose images into high- and low-frequency components. It includes modules for feature enhancement (DFFE), interactive difference modeling (FDID), and global semantic capture (PCDM).

Result: WGDF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing edge ambiguity and improving detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain modeling, particularly wavelet-guided approaches, significantly enhances change detection in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

*Meiqi Wu,Yaxuan Kang,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu,Xiaotang Chen,Yunfeng Kang,Weiqiang Wang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated method (VS-LLM) to analyze PPAT sketches for depression assessment, improving accuracy by 17.6% over traditional psychologist evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of PPAT sketches in the Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is labor-intensive and subjective, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The VS-LLM method combines visual-semantic analysis with LLM for automated depression assessment from PPAT sketches, focusing on color and space usage.

Result: The method outperforms psychologist assessments by 17.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed VS-LLM method enhances large-scale DPT analysis, contributing to mental state assessment research.

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

### [66] [CoCAViT: Compact Vision Transformer with Robust Global Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05307)
*Xuyang Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCAViT addresses the generalization gap in smaller models by introducing a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, enhancing robustness and performance on out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller models suffer disproportionately on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, indicating poor generalization. The paper aims to identify and fix architectural bottlenecks to improve robustness.

Method: Introduces CoCA, a dynamic, domain-aware global token mechanism for better local-global feature modeling. CoCAViT is proposed as a robust visual backbone.

Result: CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with notable gains on OOD benchmarks, 52.2 mAP on COCO, and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: CoCAViT effectively bridges the generalization gap in smaller models, offering robust performance across domains with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

*Xu Yuan,Liangbo Ning,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes mKG-RAG, a multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework for VQA, integrating structured knowledge from multimodal KGs to improve accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RAG-based VQA methods often introduce irrelevant content due to unstructured knowledge, reducing accuracy. Structured knowledge from multimodal KGs is proposed as a solution.

Method: The framework uses MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to build multimodal KGs, and a dual-stage retrieval strategy for efficient and precise knowledge retrieval.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in knowledge-based VQA.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG effectively enhances VQA by integrating structured multimodal knowledge, addressing limitations of traditional RAG methods.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Textual Inversion (TI)-inspired method for open-vocabulary object detection in VLMs, enabling vocabulary extension with minimal data while retaining original model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of zero-shot and natural language querying capabilities in VLMs during fine-tuning, while maintaining performance and efficiency.

Method: Extends VLM vocabulary by learning new or improving existing tokens from few examples, keeping original weights frozen.

Result: The method retains original model performance, enables zero-shot transfer, and requires less compute than full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed TI-inspired approach effectively balances performance, flexibility, and efficiency for open-vocabulary object detection.

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGabSplat improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by using 3D Gabor-based primitives for better high-frequency detail capture, efficiency, and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with high-frequency details and inefficiency due to redundant primitives.

Method: Uses 3D Gabor-based primitives with multi-directional frequency responses and a CUDA-based rasterizer for novel view rendering.

Result: Outperforms 3DGS with 1.35 dB PSNR gain, fewer primitives, and lower memory use.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat enhances rendering quality and efficiency, scalable for integration into existing 3DGS frameworks.

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorRG is a chest X-ray report generation framework that integrates patient-specific prior knowledge (clinical context and prior images) to improve diagnostic accuracy and report quality, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect patient-specific prior knowledge, leading to reports that miss diagnostic intent or disease progression. PriorRG addresses this gap by emulating real-world clinical workflows.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline: 1) Prior-guided contrastive pre-training for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and 2) Prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding to integrate prior knowledge with vision encoder outputs.

Result: PriorRG achieves significant improvements (3.6% BLEU-4, 3.8% F1 on MIMIC-CXR; 5.9% BLEU-1 on MIMIC-ABN) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PriorRG enhances clinical accuracy and fluency in chest X-ray reports by effectively leveraging prior knowledge, setting a new benchmark for automated report generation.

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

### [71] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc improves cross-view localization by dividing ground-level images into sub-images for redundant pose estimation, validating reliability, and filtering errors, achieving higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVL methods lack redundant observations for reliability assessment, limiting their practical use in GNSS-denied environments.

Method: Slice-Loc divides query images into slices, estimates 3-DoF poses for each, filters errors using geometric rigidity, and quantifies meaningfulness via false alarm estimation.

Result: Slice-Loc reduces errors exceeding 10m to under 3%, cutting mean localization error from 4.47m to 1.86m and orientation error from 3.42° to 1.24°.

Conclusion: Slice-Loc enhances CVL accuracy and reliability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, with potential for smart vehicle applications.

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

TL;DR: CT-GRAPH is a hierarchical graph attention network for automated radiology report generation, improving accuracy by modeling fine-grained organ relationships and integrating pretrained 3D medical features with a large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating radiology report generation to assist radiologists, addressing the limitation of current methods that miss fine-grained organ relationships.

Method: Uses a hierarchical graph attention network (CT-GRAPH) to structure anatomical regions into a graph, combining pretrained 3D medical feature encoders and a large language model for report generation.

Result: Achieves a 7.9% absolute improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods on the CT-RATE dataset.

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH effectively models radiological knowledge and enhances report generation accuracy, with publicly available code for further use.

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

*Mingxi Fu,Xitong Ling,Yuxuan Chen,Jiawen Li,fanglei fu,Huaitian Yuan,Tian Guan,Yonghong He,Lianghui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GNN framework with deformable attention improves pathology image analysis by dynamically capturing spatial dependencies among tissue patches, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MIL and static GNNs fail to adequately model spatial dependencies and lack specificity in attention mechanisms for pathology image analysis.

Method: Proposes a dynamic weighted directed GNN with deformable attention, incorporating learnable spatial offsets to adaptively focus on relevant tissue regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification).

Conclusion: The deformable attention mechanism effectively captures complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

*Wonjun Kang,Byeongkeun Ahn,Minjae Lee,Kevin Galim,Seunghyuk Oh,Hyung Il Koo,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNCAGE improves compositional T2I generation by leveraging attention maps for better text-image alignment without training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate attribute binding and text-image alignment in T2I generation, especially for Masked Generative Transformers.

Method: Proposes UNCAGE, a training-free method using contrastive attention guidance to prioritize unmasking tokens representing individual objects.

Result: UNCAGE enhances performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluations across benchmarks with minimal inference overhead.

Conclusion: UNCAGE effectively improves compositional fidelity in T2I generation, offering a practical solution with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images in face recognition systems with 100% accuracy using majority voting and corrective noise, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in biometric systems compromise security by manipulating training data, and current defenses struggle to balance detection and data utility.

Method: TrueBiometric uses majority voting with multiple vision-language models to detect poisoned images and applies targeted corrective noise to fix them.

Result: The method achieves 100% accuracy in detecting and correcting poisoned images without affecting clean image accuracy.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric provides a practical and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

*Jiawei Liang,Siyuan Liang,Jianjie Huang,Chenxi Si,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adversarial camouflage framework improves attack success rates on deep object detectors by addressing gradient optimization challenges in variable physical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical adversarial camouflage poses security risks in safety-critical fields like autonomous driving, but existing methods struggle with inconsistent sampling and gradient conflicts.

Method: Proposes gradient calibration for consistent updates and gradient decorrelation to eliminate redundant updates, enhancing optimization stability.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in attack success rates (13.46% across distances, 11.03% across angles) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in real-world scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust system designs against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothSA improves Slot Attention (SA) by preheating cold-start queries and differentiating transforms for first and non-first video frames, enhancing object-centric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start queries in SA lack sample-specific cues, hindering precise aggregation on the first frame, while non-first frames require different transforms. SmoothSA addresses these issues.

Method: SmoothSA preheats cold-start queries with input features via a self-distilled module and differentiates transforms for first (full iterations) and non-first frames (single iterations).

Result: Experiments show effectiveness in object discovery, recognition, and downstream tasks, with intuitive analyses of smoothed SA iterations and recurrences.

Conclusion: SmoothSA successfully addresses SA's limitations, improving performance in object-centric learning for images and videos.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIxLIP introduces a game-theory-based method for explaining vision-language model interactions, outperforming first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency maps in LIP models only capture first-order attributions, missing complex cross-modal interactions.

Method: FIxLIP uses the weighted Banzhaf interaction index for efficient, flexible decomposition of similarity in vision-language encoders.

Result: FIxLIP outperforms first-order methods on benchmarks like MS COCO and ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: FIxLIP provides high-quality explanations and is useful for comparing different vision-language models.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

### [79] [How and Why: Taming Flow Matching for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05461)
*Liangwei Li,Lin Liu,Juanxiu Liu,Jing Zhang,Ruqian Hao,Xiaohui Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new unsupervised anomaly detection method using Flow Matching (FM) is proposed, addressing limitations of conventional flow-based methods. It introduces time-reversed FM (rFM) and Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation for better anomaly separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the expressivity limitations of conventional flow-based methods in unsupervised anomaly detection and localization.

Method: Uses Flow Matching (FM) with time-reversed FM (rFM) and Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to transform data distributions and control sample trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec dataset at a single scale.

Conclusion: The proposed WT-Flow offers a theoretically grounded and scalable solution for unsupervised anomaly detection.

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset (PAS) and method (F2PASeg) are introduced for pituitary anatomy segmentation in surgery, addressing data scarcity and feature inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pituitary tumors can deform vital structures, and segmentation can improve surgical safety, but annotated datasets are rare.

Method: PAS dataset with 7,845 images from 120 videos; F2PASeg uses a Feature Fusion module to combine high-resolution and deep semantic features.

Result: F2PASeg achieves consistent real-time segmentation of critical structures, robust to surgical variations.

Conclusion: F2PASeg provides a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

*Samuel Räber,Till Aczel,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lossy image compression with high realism defends against adversarial attacks, while low-realism models are vulnerable. Realistic reconstructions inherently resist attacks without gradient masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of compression models against adversarial attacks and understand the role of image realism in defense.

Method: Constructed strong white-box and adaptive attacks on various compression models, analyzing attack difficulty and realism impact.

Result: High-realism compression models resist attacks; low-realism ones are vulnerable. Realism, not gradient masking, provides robustness.

Conclusion: Realistic reconstructions pose a challenge for adversarial attacks, suggesting future security evaluations must address realism.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OND knowledge-based prompting to improve semantic segmentation of historical maps using foundation models, outperforming UNet baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps lack consistency in patterns and styles, making it difficult for pre-trained foundation models to perform well.

Method: Proposes OND prompting to guide models with explicit prompts, replacing SAM's prompt encoder and fine-tuning on historical maps.

Result: SMOL-MapSeg accurately segments classes defined by OND knowledge and adapts to unseen classes with few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OND prompting enhances foundation models for historical map segmentation, achieving better performance than UNet.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual effort in industrial anomaly detection is inefficient; AutoIAD aims to automate the process for better scalability and performance.

Method: Uses a Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base for end-to-end automation.

Result: Outperforms general-purpose agentic frameworks and AutoML in task completion rate and AUROC, with reduced hallucination issues.

Conclusion: AutoIAD is effective for industrial anomaly detection, with its Manager agent and knowledge base being key to robust solutions.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline for shape analysis, addressing the lack of chirality-aware features in current descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chirality information is crucial in shape analysis but remains underdeveloped compared to the image domain. Existing shape descriptors often fail to distinguish left-right symmetry.

Method: The proposed pipeline uses the Diff3F framework and 2D foundation models to extract chirality-aware features for shape vertices.

Result: The extracted features were evaluated on tasks like left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation, showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in chirality-aware shape analysis and demonstrates practical utility in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI improves hand-object reconstruction from monocular videos using novel view synthesis diffusion models as supervision for unseen object regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on object templates or assume full visibility, leading to implausible reconstructions in real-world scenarios with limited viewpoints.

Method: Integrates a novel view synthesis model into hand-object reconstruction, using diffusion models as supervision for unseen regions and aligning hands to objects with visible contact constraints.

Result: MagicHOI outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively regularizes unseen object regions.

Conclusion: Novel view synthesis diffusion priors enhance 3D hand-object reconstruction, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pre-training framework for event cameras enhances feature extraction from sparse, noisy data, improving performance on downstream tasks like object recognition and optical flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and dynamic range but produce sparse, noisy data, making feature extraction challenging.

Method: The framework includes Difference-guided Masked Modeling for temporal intensity reconstruction, Backbone-fixed Feature Transition to preserve learned representations, and Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning for semantic discrimination.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tasks like object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework effectively extracts latent information from event data, demonstrating robustness and superior performance in various applications.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The

*Zewei Wu,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced pedestrian tracking framework addresses occlusion challenges by integrating richer feature representations, head keypoint detection, and an iterative Kalman filter for robust motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pedestrian tracking faces occlusion issues, especially in crowded scenes, where traditional methods relying on full-body features and linear motion assumptions fail.

Method: The framework combines detection features from regression and classification branches, uses head keypoint detection for occlusion resilience, and employs an iterative Kalman filter with 3D priors for motion modeling.

Result: The method improves tracking stability and accuracy in occlusion-heavy scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances multi-object tracking in crowded environments by addressing occlusion challenges through advanced feature and motion modeling.

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

*Ekaterina Shumitskaya,Dmitriy Vatolin,Anastasia Antsiferova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A certified defense method for IQA models using randomized smoothing in feature space, preserving image quality and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods degrade image quality by injecting noise into input space; this work aims to preserve fidelity while ensuring robustness.

Method: Randomized smoothing in feature space, analyzing the Jacobian's maximum singular value to link noise levels with input perturbations. Supports FR and NR IQA models without architectural changes.

Result: Reduces inference time by 99.5% (without certification) and 20.6% (with certification). Improves correlation with subjective scores by up to 30.9%.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, preserves image quality, and outperforms existing certified defenses in robustness and performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clinical trial data cleaning is inefficient and struggles with increasing data complexity, creating a bottleneck in drug development.

Method: Octozi combines large language models with domain-specific heuristics to assist clinical reviewers in data cleaning.

Result: AI assistance increased throughput by 6.03-fold, reduced errors from 54.67% to 8.48%, and cut false positives by 15.48-fold.

Conclusion: AI-assisted approaches can significantly improve clinical trial efficiency, accelerate timelines, and reduce costs while maintaining compliance.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

*Shaowu Chen,Wei Ma,Binhua Huang,Qingyuan Wang,Guoxin Wang,Weize Sun,Lei Huang,Deepu John*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimal Brain Connection, a structural pruning framework that evaluates parameter saliency with the Jacobian Criterion and mitigates performance loss via Equivalent Pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural pruning methods overlook parameter interconnections, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proposes the Jacobian Criterion for parameter saliency and Equivalent Pruning using autoencoders to retain pruned connections' contributions.

Result: Jacobian Criterion outperforms other metrics; Equivalent Pruning reduces performance degradation.

Conclusion: The framework improves pruning by considering parameter interactions and preserving contributions of pruned connections.

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

TL;DR: SSTGNN is a lightweight Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network for detecting AI-generated videos, outperforming state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting AI-generated videos is challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in generalizing across manipulation types and their reliance on large models.

Method: SSTGNN uses a graph-based framework to jointly analyze spatial, temporal, and spectral inconsistencies, incorporating learnable filters and differential modeling.

Result: SSTGNN achieves superior performance in in-domain and cross-domain settings, with strong robustness and up to 42.4x fewer parameters than competitors.

Conclusion: SSTGNN is a scalable and lightweight solution for real-world deployment in detecting manipulated videos.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for brand safety classification in content moderation, introducing a novel dataset and evaluating models like Gemini, GPT, and Llama against human reviewers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of online video content has made human moderation impractical, necessitating automated solutions for nuanced multimodal understanding.

Method: The study introduces a meticulously labeled multimodal and multilingual dataset and conducts a comparative analysis of MLLMs (Gemini, GPT, Llama) for brand safety classification.

Result: MLLMs show effectiveness in brand safety but have limitations and failure cases, with accuracy and cost efficiency compared to human reviewers.

Conclusion: The paper highlights MLLMs' potential for content moderation, releases the dataset for future research, and discusses model limitations.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

*Federico Spurio,Emad Bahrami,Olga Zatsarynna,Yazan Abu Farha,Gianpiero Francesca,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Action Discovery introduces a novel setup for Temporal Action Segmentation to handle ambiguous or incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets, improving performance on known and unknown actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of ambiguous actions and incomplete annotations in datasets, especially in fields like neuroscience where subtle behaviors are often unlabeled.

Method: Proposes a two-step approach: Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) for temporal intervals and Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) for semantic classification of unknown actions.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvement over baselines on datasets like Breakfast, 50Salads, and Desktop Assembly.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles partially labeled datasets, enhancing action segmentation for both known and unknown actions.

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

TL;DR: A framework called Follow-Your-Instruction uses MLLMs to automate the synthesis of high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data, addressing the challenges of costly and time-consuming real-world data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and effort of collecting large-scale real-world data for AI-generated content (AIGC) hinder downstream applications. Existing methods relying on manual scene construction lack scalability and accuracy.

Method: The framework uses MLLMs to collect assets and descriptions, construct 3D layouts, refine semantics with VLMs, and generate temporally coherent future frames.

Result: Experiments show the synthetic data significantly improves baseline model performance in 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction is a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART framework enhances VLP models for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition by refining intra-class localization and leveraging LLM-derived inter-class relational knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLP models lack fine-grained localization and fail to utilize structured relational knowledge, limiting performance in OV-MLR.

Method: DART introduces Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) for intra-class refinement and Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) for inter-class transfer using a Class Relationship Graph (CRG) from an LLM.

Result: DART achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: DART effectively combines adaptive intra-class refinement and inter-class transfer, improving OV-MLR performance.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeTok tokenizer improves vision generation with Group-wise Quantization and Generative Decoding, achieving better compression and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers struggle with balancing compression ratios and reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Introduces Group-wise Quantization (GQ) for efficient memory use and Generative Decoding (GD) for probabilistic modeling of visual data.

Result: Achieves record-low zero-shot rFID (0.12) and outperforms competitors in high compression scenarios.

Conclusion: WeTok sets a new standard for visual tokenizers with superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

TL;DR: LLaVA-RE is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework for binary image-text relevancy evaluation, addressing diverse text formats and scenario-specific relevancy definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating image-text relevancy is challenging due to diverse text formats and varying relevancy definitions. MLLMs are ideal for this task due to their flexibility.

Method: LLaVA-RE, based on the LLaVA architecture, uses detailed task instructions and multimodal in-context samples, along with a novel binary relevancy dataset.

Result: Experimental results confirm the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE successfully leverages MLLMs for binary image-text relevancy evaluation, offering a flexible and effective solution.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: Hi3DEval is a hierarchical framework for evaluating 3D generative content, combining object-level and part-level analysis with material realism assessment. It outperforms image-based metrics and aligns better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D content quality assessment rely on image-based metrics and lack spatial coherence, material authenticity, and local detail evaluation.

Method: Hi3DEval introduces a hierarchical framework with object-level and part-level evaluation, material realism assessment, and a dataset (Hi3DBench) with multi-agent annotations. It uses hybrid 3D representations for automated scoring.

Result: The approach outperforms image-based metrics in capturing 3D characteristics and aligns better with human preferences.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval provides a scalable, holistic alternative to manual evaluations for 3D generative content.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2 is a challenging dataset for video object segmentation (VOS) designed to address real-world complexities, showing performance drops in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS datasets focus on simple scenarios, limiting generalization to real-world complexities. MOSEv2 aims to bridge this gap.

Method: MOSEv2 introduces 5,024 videos with 701,976 masks, featuring complex scenes like occlusions, adverse weather, and camouflaged objects.

Result: Benchmarking shows significant performance drops (e.g., SAM2 from 76.4% to 50.9%), indicating current methods struggle with real-world challenges.

Conclusion: MOSEv2 highlights the limitations of current VOS methods and provides a benchmark for advancing research in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

TL;DR: GAP introduces a method to convert colorless 3D point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians using text guidance, multi-view optimization, and surface-anchoring for geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians is crucial, especially for colorless point clouds, which remain a challenge.

Method: GAP uses a multi-view optimization framework with a depth-aware image diffusion model, surface-anchoring for geometry, and diffuse-based inpainting for hard-to-observe regions.

Result: GAP successfully generates high-fidelity 3D Gaussians from synthetic and real-world point clouds, including large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: GAP advances point-to-Gaussian generation, offering a robust solution for various complexity levels.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer is a cancelable face generation framework that protects privacy while maintaining recognition utility by mixing latent codes and refining them with a multi-objective loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in face recognition by ensuring revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility, which existing anonymization methods lack.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained generative model's latent space to mix real face latent codes with synthetic ones derived from revocable keys, refined via multi-objective loss.

Result: Generates high-quality cancelable faces compatible with existing FR systems, achieving over 11% better privacy protection on commercial APIs.

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer effectively balances privacy and utility, outperforming recent cancelable biometric methods.

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

Result: Achieves competitive performance in speaker profiling and an 8.8% Equal Error Rate in x-vector comparisons.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enriches transcriptions with speaker metadata while maintaining modularity and speed.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parity-aware BPE improves tokenization fairness across languages without compromising global compression or downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tokenization algorithms favor dominant languages, disadvantaging lower-resource ones, exacerbating inequalities.

Method: Introduces Parity-aware BPE, which prioritizes compression gain for the worst-compressed language at each merge step.

Result: Achieves more equitable token counts across languages with minimal impact on global compression and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE addresses cross-lingual tokenization disparities effectively.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Joint ASR and pitch accent detection model improves ASR performance and pitch accent detection, reducing WER by 28.3% and improving F1-score by 41%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR systems by incorporating prosodic cues like pitch accent, which are often overlooked in pretrained models.

Method: Introduces a joint model combining ASR and pitch accent detection, leveraging semi-supervised speech representations.

Result: Pitch accent detection improves by 41% in F1-score; ASR WER decreases by 28.3% on LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: Extending pretrained speech models to include prosodic cues like pitch accent significantly boosts performance.

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERSIST evaluates personality stability in large language models (LLMs), revealing significant variability in responses despite interventions, suggesting current models lack behavioral consistency for safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and assess the stability of personality-like traits in LLMs, which is crucial for their safe and predictable deployment.

Method: Evaluated 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted personality instruments, varying question order, paraphrasing, personas, and reasoning modes.

Result: Key findings: (1) High response variability even in large models (400B+), (2) Prompt reordering shifts personality measurements by up to 20%, (3) Interventions like chain-of-thought reasoning increase variability, (4) LLM-adapted instruments show instability similar to human-centric ones.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency, making personality-based alignment strategies inadequate for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

TL;DR: RCR-Router is a dynamic, role-aware context routing framework for multi-agent LLMs, reducing token usage by up to 30% while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coordination schemes in multi-agent LLM systems are inefficient due to static or full-context routing, leading to high token consumption and limited adaptability.

Method: Introduces RCR-Router, which dynamically selects relevant memory subsets per agent based on role and task stage, guided by a lightweight scoring policy and iterative memory refinement.

Result: Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show reduced token usage (up to 30%) with maintained or improved answer quality.

Conclusion: Structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation are key for scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for detecting linguistic bias in LLMs using shibboleths, showing hedged responses are penalized by 25.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs inadvertently reveal and penalize demographic attributes through linguistic patterns.

Method: Interview simulations with 100 validated question-response pairs, isolating linguistic variations while maintaining semantic equivalence.

Result: Hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings, revealing systematic bias in LLMs.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a framework for detecting linguistic discrimination in AI, aiding fairness in automated systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language clustering framework to address ambiguities in verb semantics for evaluating visual activity recognition systems, showing better alignment with human judgements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard exact-match evaluation fails to capture ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation, leading to incomplete model performance assessment.

Method: A vision-language clustering framework constructs verb sense clusters for robust evaluation, tested on the imSitu dataset.

Result: Each image maps to 2.8 sense clusters on average, representing distinct perspectives. Cluster-based evaluation aligns better with human judgements than standard methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more nuanced and human-aligned assessment of model performance in visual activity recognition.

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM framework improves extraction of social determinants of health (SDoH) factors from unstructured text, outperforming state-of-the-art models and enhancing explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data-driven SDoH analysis for suicide prevention, including long-tailed factor distributions and limited model explainability.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage LLM framework, comparing it to BioBERT, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek-R1, and evaluates its impact on annotation speed and accuracy.

Result: The framework boosts SDoH extraction performance, provides intermediate explanations, and achieves comparable/better results with reduced costs.

Conclusion: Enhances accuracy and transparency in SDoH extraction, aiding early risk identification and suicide prevention strategies.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for DiaASQ by partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using structural entropy minimization, improving extraction accuracy and reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume uniform sentiment distribution, but dialogues often contain independent sub-dialogues, introducing noise in extraction.

Method: Partition dialogues into sub-dialogues via structural entropy minimization, then use a two-step framework for quadruple extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses noise and improves quadruple extraction in dialogues.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

*Shu Han Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning decoder-only LLMs like Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 achieves competitive AMR parsing performance, with LLaMA 3.2 matching SOTA parsers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a straightforward approach for AMR parsing by finetuning decoder-only LLMs, avoiding complex architectures.

Method: Finetuned four LLM architectures (Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, DeepSeek R1) on the LDC2020T02 AMR3.0 test set.

Result: LLaMA 3.2 achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804, comparable to SOTA parsers. Phi 3.5 excelled in structural validity.

Conclusion: Decoder-only LLMs, especially LLaMA 3.2, offer a promising and simple alternative to complex AMR parsers.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-LoRA challenges the multi-adapter paradigm in PEFT for LLMs, showing that a single high-rank adapter or aligned multi-head architecture outperforms complex systems, emphasizing shared representations over task-specific isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of multi-adapter systems in multi-task learning for LLMs, questioning the need for structural diversity.

Method: Proposes Align-LoRA, a simplified single-adapter or aligned multi-head architecture with an explicit loss for task representation alignment.

Result: Align-LoRA outperforms complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems, validating the importance of shared representations.

Conclusion: A simpler, shared-representation approach is more effective for adapting LLMs to multiple tasks, with Align-LoRA setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: MultiCheck is a unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification, combining text and image encoders with a fusion module to improve fact-checking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of multimodal misinformation by integrating textual and visual evidence for more accurate fact-checking.

Method: Uses dedicated encoders for text and images, a fusion module for cross-modal relationships, and a contrastive learning objective for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.84 on the Factify 2 dataset, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of explicit multimodal reasoning for scalable and interpretable fact-checking.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEE-RAG, a framework addressing performance issues in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) caused by long context lengths, using entropy engineering to stabilize attention dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) face knowledge limitations, and RAG, while helpful, suffers from performance degradation due to unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution in long retrieval contexts.

Method: Proposes BEE-RAG, leveraging entropy invariance to balance context entropy and reformulate attention dynamics. Includes a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and adaptive fine-tuning.

Result: BEE-RAG demonstrates effectiveness across multiple RAG tasks, improving adaptability to varying context lengths.

Conclusion: BEE-RAG successfully addresses entropy and attention issues in RAG, enhancing performance through balanced entropy engineering and adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'attention basin' in LLMs, where models focus on sequence ends, neglecting the middle. AttnRank reranks inputs to align critical info with high-attention spots, boosting performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate positional bias in LLMs, where performance depends on input sequence order.

Method: Introduces AttnRank, a two-stage framework: (i) calibrates positional attention preferences, (ii) reranks inputs to align key info with high-attention positions.

Result: AttnRank improves performance across 10 LLMs in multi-hop QA and few-shot tasks without model changes.

Conclusion: AttnRank effectively leverages positional attention biases to enhance LLM performance, offering a simple, model-agnostic solution.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Motivation: Current benchmarks overlook ethical reasoning in LLMs for healthcare, necessitating a systematic evaluation of their alignment with medical ethics principles.

Method: The benchmark includes multiple-choice and open-ended questions from authoritative sources, validated by medical experts, and evaluates LLMs' ethical reasoning.

Result: LLMs show a gap between ethical knowledge and practical application, struggling with Beneficence dilemmas. Closed-source models lead, but medical fine-tuning improves ethical competence.

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA provides a scalable framework to diagnose ethical weaknesses in LLMs, promoting responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Result: MulCoT-RD achieves strong performance on JMSRC with only 3B parameters, showing robust generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses resource constraints while maintaining performance and interpretability in multimodal sentiment analysis.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

### [119] [Pruning Large Language Models by Identifying and Preserving Functional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05239)
*Yiheng Liu,Junhao Ning,Sichen Xia,Xiaohui Gao,Ning Qiang,Bao Ge,Junwei Han,Xintao Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured pruning method for LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks, inspired by neural networks in the human brain, to improve pruning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods disrupt LLM functionalities by ignoring neuron interactions. The study aims to preserve functional networks for better performance.

Method: Treats LLMs as digital brains, decomposes them into functional networks, and prunes by preserving key neurons within these networks.

Result: Successfully identifies functional networks and key neurons, enabling efficient pruning.

Conclusion: The method improves pruning by preserving functional architecture, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

### [120] [CodeBoost: Boosting Code LLMs by Squeezing Knowledge from Code Snippets with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05242)
*Sijie Wang,Quanjiang Guo,Kai Zhao,Yawei Zhang,Xin Li,Xiang Li,Siqi Li,Rui She,Shangshu Yu,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeBoost is a post-training framework for code LLMs that enhances performance using code snippets without human-annotated instructions, addressing scalability issues in instruction-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code LLMs rely on labor-intensive human-annotated instructions, while code snippets are abundant but underutilized. CodeBoost aims to bridge this gap.

Method: CodeBoost uses maximum-clique curation, bi-directional prediction, error-aware prediction, heterogeneous augmentation, and heterogeneous rewarding to train models purely from code snippets.

Result: Experiments show CodeBoost consistently improves performance across multiple code LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeBoost provides a scalable and effective alternative to instruction-based post-training for code LLMs.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

### [121] [ASCoT: An Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought Method for Late-Stage Fragility in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05282)
*Dongxu Zhang,Ning Yang,Jihua Zhu,Jinnan Yang,Miao Xin,Baoliang Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the 'cascading failure' hypothesis in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, revealing 'Late-Stage Fragility'—errors in later stages corrupt answers more. It introduces ASCoT, an adaptive correction method, improving accuracy over standard CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of reasoning chains in LLMs, particularly the overlooked vulnerability of late-stage errors.

Method: Introduces ASCoT with an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) and Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE) to prioritize and correct high-risk late-stage errors.

Result: ASCoT outperforms baselines like standard CoT on benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH), demonstrating higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction in LLM reasoning, moving beyond uniform verification.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

*Sukannya Purkayastha,Nils Dycke,Anne Lauscher,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers by generating synthetic data with LLMs and training tailored agents, showing improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-reviewing is a decision-making process needing expert context, and prior research suggests dialogue agents can assist effectively.

Method: Generate synthetic data using LLMs via self-refinement, train dialogue agents, and test in real-world meta-reviewing.

Result: The method produces high-quality synthetic data and outperforms off-the-shelf LLM-based assistants.

Conclusion: Dialogue agents trained on synthetic data enhance meta-reviewing efficiency, validated in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SONAR-LLM is a decoder-only transformer that combines the semantic abstraction of LCM with token-level cross-entropy, achieving competitive generation quality without diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To retain the semantic benefits of LCM while simplifying training by eliminating diffusion sampling and restoring a likelihood-based signal.

Method: Uses a decoder-only transformer supervised by token-level cross-entropy via a frozen SONAR decoder, blending continuous embeddings with traditional training.

Result: Competitive generation quality across model sizes (39M to 1.3B parameters), with scaling trends and benchmark results provided.

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM effectively balances semantic abstraction and training efficiency, with released code and checkpoints for reproducibility.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

### [124] [Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05337)
*Jiameng Huang,Baijiong Lin,Guhao Feng,Jierun Chen,Di He,Lu Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGRS reduces redundant reasoning in LRLMs by suppressing reflection triggers when confidence is high, cutting token usage by 18.5%-41.9% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overthinking in LRLMs leads to unnecessary token usage, higher costs, and reduced utility.

Method: CGRS dynamically suppresses reflection triggers during high-confidence responses, avoiding redundant cycles.

Result: Reduces token usage significantly (18.5%-41.9%) while maintaining accuracy across benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: CGRS offers a practical, model-agnostic solution for efficient reasoning without retraining or architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

*Fenya Wasserroth,Eleftherios Avramidis,Vera Czehmann,Tanja Kojic,Fabrizio Nunnari,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of adjustable features in a sign language avatar on Hololens 2, finding no significant UX or comprehensibility improvements despite user preference for adjustability. Key issues included missing SL elements and implementation flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how adjustable features in a sign language avatar affect user experience, comprehensibility, and acceptability among expert German Sign Language users.

Method: Analyzed interactions of expert DGS users with adjustable and non-adjustable avatars, evaluating UX, comprehensibility, and acceptability.

Result: No significant UX or comprehensibility improvements; adjustable avatar caused higher stress. Users preferred adjustability but found the system functionally lacking.

Conclusion: Personalisation alone is insufficient; SL avatars must be comprehensible by default. Recommendations include improving animation, interaction interfaces, and using participatory design.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

*Samy Ateia,Udo Kruschwitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges of applying autonomous LLM-driven search systems like RAG to domain-specific professional tasks, using BioASQ CLEF 2025 as a case study. It evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs with a self-feedback mechanism for iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professional search tasks, such as biomedical research, require high expertise and transparency, but autonomous systems may misalign with expert needs. The study aims to assess LLM self-correction and its alignment with expert requirements.

Method: The study tested reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs (e.g., Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini) with a self-feedback mechanism for iterative output refinement. Performance was evaluated on query expansion and multiple answer types (yes/no, factoid, list, ideal).

Result: Preliminary results show varied performance of the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks, suggesting mixed effectiveness of LLM self-correction.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into LLM self-correction and highlights the need for future comparisons between LLM-generated feedback and human expert input in professional search systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

TL;DR: MyCulture is a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture, addressing biases in high-resource language dominance by using an open-ended multiple-choice format in Bahasa Melayu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit cultural biases due to training data skewed toward high-resource languages, limiting accurate representation of diverse cultures, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Introduces MyCulture, a benchmark with six cultural pillars, using an open-ended multiple-choice format to reduce guessing and format bias. Analyzes structural and language biases.

Result: Evaluation shows significant disparities in cultural comprehension among LLMs, emphasizing the need for culturally inclusive benchmarks.

Conclusion: Culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks are crucial for fair and accurate LLM development and assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Result: A 20-month study of 50 models reveals performance ceilings on memorization and contamination vulnerabilities, with LLMEval-3 showing robust ranking stability.

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 provides a credible, dynamic evaluation framework for LLMs, promoting trustworthy standards beyond static benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with fine-grained, token-level tasks despite high-level semantic performance, necessitating a tool to assess and improve these capabilities.

Method: TASE includes 10 tasks (e.g., character counting, syntactic parsing) across Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set and synthetic data pipeline. Over 30 LLMs were tested, and a custom Qwen2.5-14B model was trained using GRPO.

Result: Human performance significantly outperforms LLMs, highlighting persistent weaknesses in token-level reasoning.

Conclusion: TASE identifies LLM limitations and provides a diagnostic tool for future improvements in low-level language understanding and cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: To systematically analyze and compare existing creativity metrics to understand their strengths and weaknesses in diverse creative tasks.

Method: Examination and comparison of four creativity measures (creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, LLM-as-a-Judge) across creative writing, problem-solving, and research ideation.

Result: Metrics show limited consistency, each capturing different aspects of creativity, with notable limitations like bias and instability.

Conclusion: There is a need for more robust and generalizable creativity evaluation frameworks aligned with human judgments.

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG) improves LLM reasoning by decomposing questions into logical sub-questions, resolving dependencies, and preventing error propagation, outperforming RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks and hallucinations; RAG lacks structured reasoning. LAG aims to enhance logical grounding and robustness.

Method: LAG decomposes questions into atomic sub-questions, resolves them sequentially with dependency-aware reasoning, and uses a termination mechanism for unanswerable parts.

Result: LAG reduces hallucination, improves reasoning robustness, and aligns LLM outputs with human cognition on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LAG offers a principled, logic-driven alternative to RAG, enhancing LLM performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates implicit biases in LLMs using the 20 Questions game, revealing geographic disparities in performance, particularly favoring the Global North and West.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover subtle biases in LLMs that persist despite mitigation efforts, using a proactive questioning approach instead of direct probing.

Method: Evaluated LLMs in the 20 Questions game across seven languages and two gameplay configurations, using the Geo20Q+ dataset of notable entities from diverse regions.

Result: LLMs show significant geographic disparities, performing better for Global North/West entities. Wikipedia pageviews and corpus frequency only partially explain these gaps. Language had minimal impact.

Conclusion: Creative evaluation frameworks like the 20 Questions game reveal hidden biases in LLMs, highlighting geographic and cultural disparities in reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at

*Santosh T. Y. S. S,Youssef Tarek Elkhayat,Oana Ichim,Pranav Shetty,Dongsheng Wang,Zhiqiang Ma,Armineh Nourbakhsh,Xiaomo Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoLex, a decoding strategy for legal text generation, improves faithfulness to source context by dynamically blending model-generated and copied content, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in the legal domain often produce unfaithful or hallucinatory outputs, and current solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation lack guaranteed context integration.

Method: CoCoLex combines model-generated vocabulary distribution with context-derived copying, guided by model confidence to ensure fidelity.

Result: CoCoLex surpasses existing context-aware decoding methods on five legal benchmarks, especially in long-form tasks.

Conclusion: CoCoLex effectively enhances faithfulness in legal text generation by leveraging confidence-guided copying.

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

*Guang Yang,Xinyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A frequency-based uncertainty quantification method for LLMs in MCQA, using conformal prediction to ensure reliability and outperforming logit-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of LLMs (e.g., hallucination, overconfidence) in high-risk MCQA applications.

Method: Proposes frequency-based predictive entropy (PE) via multiple independent samplings of model outputs, validated with conformal prediction.

Result: Outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing correct/incorrect predictions (AUROC) and controls miscoverage rates effectively.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable, model-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification in MCQA, enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether political opinions in multilingual large language models (MLLMs) differ across languages or transfer uniformly. Findings show minimal cross-lingual differences in unaligned models and uniform opinion shifts after alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if political opinions in MLLMs vary by language or transfer across languages, addressing gaps in understanding socio-cultural and political alignment in these models.

Method: Analyzed MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages by prompting them with political statements from voting advice applications. Evaluated models before and after alignment using direct preference optimization with English data.

Result: Unaligned models showed few significant cross-lingual differences in political opinions. Alignment shifted opinions uniformly across all languages.

Conclusion: Political opinions transfer between languages in MLLMs, highlighting challenges in achieving socio-linguistic and political alignment.

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

*Shaoxiong Zhan,Yanlin Lai,Ziyu Lu,Dahua Lin,Ziqing Yang,Fei Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathSmith is a framework for synthesizing challenging math problems to improve LLM reasoning by generating diverse, high-difficulty data from scratch using concept-explanation pairs and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on human-written templates, limiting diversity and scalability in training data for LLM mathematical reasoning.

Method: MathSmith constructs problems from PlanetMath concept pairs, uses predefined strategies for difficulty, and employs reinforcement learning to optimize validity, complexity, and consistency.

Result: Outperforms baselines on benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench) in short and long CoT settings.

Conclusion: MathSmith demonstrates scalability, generalization, and transferability, proving the value of synthetic high-difficulty data for advancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cooper, a RL framework that jointly optimizes policy and reward models to address limitations of rule-based and model-based rewards, enhancing robustness and mitigating reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward paradigms (rule-based and model-based) have limitations: rule-based lacks robustness, and model-based is prone to reward hacking. The goal is to improve RL performance by addressing these issues.

Method: Proposes Cooper, which co-optimizes policy and reward models, leveraging rule-based precision for correct responses and dynamically training the reward model. Introduces a hybrid annotation strategy and reference-based reward modeling (VerifyRM).

Result: Cooper mitigates reward hacking and improves RL performance, e.g., a 0.54% accuracy gain on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. VerifyRM outperforms same-size models on VerifyBench.

Conclusion: Dynamically updating reward models effectively combats reward hacking, offering insights for better RL integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniEAR evaluates language models' embodied reasoning, revealing challenges in tool usage and multi-agent coordination, with performance drops under dynamic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore language models' capacity for embodied reasoning, which remains underexplored despite their abstract reasoning prowess.

Method: OmniEAR uses text-based environments to model physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination across 1,500 scenarios.

Result: Performance degrades under dynamic constraints (56-85% for tools, 63-85% for collaboration), with fine-tuning helping single-agent tasks but not multi-agent ones.

Conclusion: Embodied reasoning poses unique challenges beyond current models' capabilities, establishing OmniEAR as a benchmark for advancing embodied AI.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

### [140] [Learning to Reason for Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05618)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) by proposing a novel reward function for online RL, improving factuality, detail, and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R-LLMs struggle with factuality and hallucinations in long-form tasks, and existing methods like offline RL with FActScore lead to reward hacking.

Method: A new reward function is introduced for online RL, balancing factual precision, detail level, and relevance.

Result: The model reduces hallucinations by 23.1%, increases detail by 23%, and maintains response helpfulness.

Conclusion: The proposed reward function effectively enhances factual reasoning in R-LLMs without compromising quality.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probes analyze persuasion dynamics in LLM-human conversations, outperforming prompting in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs persuade humans in multi-turn conversations using lightweight probes.

Method: Apply linear probes trained on persuasion aspects (success, personality, strategy) using cognitive science insights.

Result: Probes effectively identify persuasion points and strategies, sometimes outperforming prompting.

Conclusion: Probes offer a scalable method to study complex behaviors like deception in multi-turn settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H-NET++ is a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model for byte-level language models, improving performance in morphologically-rich languages like Persian by learning linguistically-informed segmentation without explicit supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level models avoid fragile tokenizers but struggle with computational inefficiency in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs) due to long byte sequences per word.

Method: Proposes H-NET++ with innovations: (1) lightweight Transformer for cross-chunk attention, (2) two-level latent hyper-prior for consistency, (3) handling orthographic artifacts, and (4) curriculum-based training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on Persian corpus: 0.159 BPB reduction, 5.4pp ParsGLUE gain, 53% robustness to ZWNJ corruption, and 73.8% F1 on morphological boundaries.

Conclusion: H-NET++ demonstrates effective tokenizer-free solutions for MRLs, aligning learned chunks with morphology while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.
