### [1] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate VR training content generation, reducing development time and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR training is effective but resource-intensive to develop; automating content creation can address this challenge.

Method: A system with an LLM module extracts task info from text, and an intelligent module converts it into VR animations and visual cues.

Result: The approach improves training effectiveness and reduces development overhead, making VR training more scalable.

Conclusion: Automating VR training content with LLMs is a viable solution to enhance scalability and adaptability in workforce training.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [2] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet GÃ¶khan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD) algorithm to improve circle fitting accuracy in noisy datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy point sets compromise circle fitting accuracy in industrial quality control and design, necessitating effective outlier detection methods.

Method: The PCOD algorithm transforms points into polar coordinates, calculates local and global standard deviations, and identifies outliers by comparing local means with global deviation.

Result: PCOD outperforms ten circle fitting algorithms and five outlier detection methods, achieving higher accuracy in diameter measurement of industrial parts.

Conclusion: The PCOD algorithm enhances circle fitting accuracy in noisy industrial datasets, proving its practical utility.

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods to improve measurement accuracy in camera systems using reference parts, reducing errors significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement errors in camera systems persist despite specialized equipment, especially for parts of varying diameters.

Method: Two approaches: conversion factor-based and pixel-based methods using known reference parts.

Result: Errors reduced from 13-114 micrometers to 1-2 micrometers in tests on glass and metal samples.

Conclusion: The methods enhance accuracy and reliability in diameter measurements, requiring only a few reference parts.

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multimodal emotion recognition by leveraging trustworthy reasoning from MLLMs and addressing class imbalance.

Method: Uses Gemini for modality-separable reasoning traces and introduces Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning for class balance.

Result: Substantial performance improvements on the MER2024 benchmark.

Conclusion: MLLM reasoning and lightweight fusion networks synergize for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify and segment sound-producing
objects in videos by leveraging both visual and audio modalities. It has

provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks,
highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies,
and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current
challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

### [6] [A Large Language Model Powered Integrated Circuit Footprint Geometry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03725)
*Yida Wang,Taiting Lu,Runze Liu,Lanqing Yang,Yifan Yang,Zhe Chen,Yuehai Wang,Yixin Liu,Kaiyuan Lin,Xiaomeng Chen,Dian Ding,Yijie Li,Yi-Chao Chen,Yincheng Jin,Mahanth Gowda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4-IC8K, a framework using LLMs for automated IC footprint geometry labeling from mechanical drawings, addressing challenges in visual perception and outperforming existing LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parsing of IC footprint geometry is challenging due to unstructured drawings and abstract annotations, with no existing methods for direct labeling from mechanical drawings.

Method: Proposes LLM4-IC8K, a two-stage framework: trains LMMs on synthetic IC diagrams for geometric reasoning, then fine-tunes on real-world datasheets. Introduces ICGeo8K dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: LLM4-IC8K outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs in footprint geometry labeling, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of current LMMs in IC footprint geometry understanding, offering a scalable solution for automated labeling.

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

*Tai Hyoung Rhee,Dong-guw Lee,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for denoising thermal infrared (TIR) images using latent-space and wavelet-domain optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and showing robust zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIR images are valuable for robotic perception but suffer from heavy fixed-pattern noise, hindering tasks like object detection and mapping.

Method: Leverages a pretrained stable diffusion model fine-tuned with a novel loss function combining latent-space and wavelet-domain losses, plus a cascaded refinement stage.

Result: Superior performance on benchmarks and robust zero-shot generalization to real-world TIR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively denoises TIR images, making it practical for robotic applications.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

### [8] [What is Beneath Misogyny: Misogynous Memes Classification and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03732)
*Kushal Kanwar,Dushyant Singh Chauhan,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-Misogyny, a multimodal approach to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes by analyzing text and image modalities separately and unifying them via cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misogynistic ideologies can propagate through seemingly harmless memes, posing a challenge due to their multimodal nature and nuanced societal contexts.

Method: MM-Misogyny processes text and image separately, unifies them with cross-attention, and uses a classifier and LLM for labeling, categorization, and explanation.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, detecting and classifying misogyny while providing granular insights into its manifestations.

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny offers an effective solution for understanding and combating misogynistic content in memes, supported by a new dataset (WBMS).

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset
are available at

### [9] [StorySync: Training-Free Subject Consistency in Text-to-Image Generation via Region Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03735)
*Gopalji Gaur,Mohammadreza Zolfaghari,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for generating consistent subjects in visual stories using text-to-image diffusion models, avoiding costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for maintaining subject consistency in visual storytelling are computationally expensive and disrupt pre-trained model capabilities.

Method: Uses masked cross-image attention sharing and Regional Feature Harmonization to align and refine subject features dynamically.

Result: Successfully generates visually consistent subjects across scenarios without compromising the model's creativity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently ensures subject consistency in visual storytelling while preserving the diffusion model's capabilities.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

### [10] [Fusion of Pervasive RF Data with Spatial Images via Vision Transformers for Enhanced Mapping in Smart Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03736)
*Rafayel Mkrtchyan,Armen Manukyan,Hrant Khachatrian,Theofanis P. Raptis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using DINOv2 and RF data improves building mapping accuracy, outperforming baselines with a 65.3% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional smart city mapping techniques (cost, accessibility, accuracy) and biases in open-source data.

Method: Integrates DINOv2 architecture to combine open-source maps with RF data, using a vision transformer for joint processing.

Result: Achieves 65.3% IoU, surpassing erroneous maps (40.1%), RF-only (37.3%), and non-AI fusion (42.2%).

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances mapping accuracy by leveraging multimodal data and spatial dependencies.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

### [11] [VQ-DeepISC: Vector Quantized-Enabled Digital Semantic Communication with Channel Adaptive Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03740)
*Jianqiao Chen,Tingting Zhu,Huishi Song,Nan Ma,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-DeepISC, a digital semantic communication system, uses vector quantization and deep learning for efficient, robust semantic feature transmission, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in digitizing analog semantic features while preserving continuity and context, ensuring robustness to channel degradation.

Method: The system employs a Swin Transformer for feature extraction, VQ modules for discrete latent spaces, and an attention-driven channel adaptation module. Training includes KLD regularization and EMA for stability.

Result: Superior reconstruction fidelity compared to benchmark methods, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC effectively bridges semantic and digital communication, offering practical advantages in feature transmission.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

*Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Maosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a weakly supervised deep learning model for geospatial object detection, addressing challenges like lack of training data and spatial neglect in AI. It uses Tobler's first law, attention maps, and multistage training, applied to detect Mars craters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in GeoAI, such as limited training data and ignoring spatial principles, hinder AI-geospatial integration. The paper aims to address these by developing a weakly supervised object detection model.

Method: A spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law, incorporating attention maps and multistage training for weakly supervised object detection.

Result: The model successfully detects natural features like Mars craters and generalizes to Earth and other planetary surfaces.

Conclusion: The research advances GeoAI by improving theoretical and methodological foundations for weakly supervised geospatial object detection.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

*Riccardo Fiorista,Awad Abdelhalim,Anson F. Stewart,Gabriel L. Pincus,Ian Thistle,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using CCTV footage and computer vision to estimate urban rail platform occupancy, comparing three methods and introducing a novel linear-optimization approach for accurate real-time crowd estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving safety, efficiency, and customer experience by accurately estimating platform crowding in real-time, addressing the limitations of indirect proxies like fare data or staff observations.

Method: Three computer vision approaches: object detection (YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, APGCC), crowd-level classification (Crowd-ViT), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3), plus a novel linear-optimization method for count extraction.

Result: Tested on a large WMATA dataset, the methods showed computer vision can effectively estimate crowding, enabling precise real-time responses.

Conclusion: CCTV data alone can provide accurate real-time crowd estimation, supporting timely operational decisions for crowding mitigation.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate weed segmentation in precision agriculture, addressing common image degradation issues like blur and noise.

Method: A quality-aware framework analyzes image degradation (blur, noise) and routes inputs to specialized transformer models (baseline, Fisher Vector for noise, Lucy-Robinson decoder for blur).

Result: Outperforms CNN-based methods in segmentation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

*Bevin V,Ananthakrishnan P V,Ragesh KR,Sanjay M,Vineeth S,Bibin Wilson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic invoices using OCR, LLM-generated content, and inpainting to create diverse datasets for training document intelligence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming privacy and cost barriers in acquiring large-scale, diverse datasets for invoice processing.

Method: Combines OCR for layout extraction, LLM for synthetic content, and inpainting to replace text while preserving layout.

Result: Produces realistic synthetic invoice images and aligned structured data (JSON) for scalable dataset amplification.

Conclusion: Enables robust training of document intelligence models by automating the creation of varied datasets.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

Motivation: Existing RFT-based IQA methods lack supervision for the 'think' process and direct fine-tuning limits performance.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage-1 enhances visual perception using a new dataset and multi-task rewards; Stage-2 supervises the 'think' process with probability difference rewards.

Result: Refine-IQA models excel in perception and scoring tasks, with strong 'think' capability.

Conclusion: Refine-IQA addresses gaps in RFT for IQA, improving performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-PreNet, a deep-learning pipeline, addresses data preprocessing bottlenecks in 4D-STEM by integrating denoising, center correction, and distortion calibration, improving accuracy and enabling high-throughput analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput 4D-STEM data acquisition is hindered by pervasive noise, beam drift, and distortions, which bias measurements. Conventional methods lack generalizability.

Method: 4D-PreNet combines attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures, trained on diverse simulated datasets for robust generalization.

Result: The pipeline reduces mean squared error by 50% in denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization (errors <0.04 pixels), outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet enhances 4D-STEM real-time analysis, enabling reliable automated characterization by addressing preprocessing challenges.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

TL;DR: HPSv3 introduces a human-centric metric for text-to-image models, leveraging a large dataset and VLM-based preference model, with CoHP for iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-centric metrics for text-to-image models lack data coverage, feature extraction, and loss function efficiency.

Method: HPSv3 uses a wide-spectrum dataset (HPDv3) and a VLM-based preference model with uncertainty-aware ranking loss. CoHP iteratively refines images using HPSv3.

Result: HPSv3 proves robust for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP enhances image quality without extra data.

Conclusion: HPSv3 and CoHP provide a human-aligned, efficient solution for evaluating and improving text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage deep learning framework using CNNs, ResNet-50, and YOLO for automated crater detection and identification on Mars and the Moon, with YOLO excelling in balanced detection and ResNet-50 in large crater precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Impact craters are key for planetary science, and automated detection using deep learning can enhance research efficiency and accuracy.

Method: A two-stage approach: first, crater identification with CNNs, ResNet-50, and YOLO; second, YOLO-based localization. Remote sensing data from Mars and the Moon are used.

Result: YOLO shows balanced detection performance, while ResNet-50 is precise for large craters.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects and identifies craters, with YOLO and ResNet-50 offering complementary strengths.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

*Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Ifrah Zawar,P. Thomas Fletcher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model for generating point-based shapes with correspondences, outperforming existing methods in realism and enabling downstream tasks like conditional and counterfactual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods ignore point correspondences in shape generation, limiting applications like disease progression modeling. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model trained on OASIS-3 data to generate realistic point-based shapes while preserving correspondences.

Result: The model generates highly realistic hippocampal shapes and supports tasks like conditional and counterfactual generation.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap in correspondence-preserving shape generation, with practical applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

*Xiangcen Wu,Shaheer U. Saeed,Yipei Wang,Ester Bonmati Coll,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A recommendation system for prostate cancer segmentation suggests optimal imaging modalities and regions to maximize accuracy, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prostate cancer segmentation by mimicking radiologists' mixed strategies of inspecting modalities and regions dynamically.

Method: A policy network recommends modalities and regions for a pre-trained segmentation network, iterating until optimal localization is achieved.

Result: Validated on 1325 MRI images, the method improves efficiency and accuracy, even outperforming standard networks.

Conclusion: The system's independent strategy hints at potential for assisting radiologists and improving guidelines like PI-RADS.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: A two-stage training paradigm reduces reliance on manual curation for audio-synchronized visual animation, using noisy pretraining and small-scale fine-tuning, achieving scalability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require expensive manual curation of high-quality training videos, limiting scalability to diverse audio-video classes.

Method: A two-stage approach: pretraining on noisy, large-scale videos, followed by fine-tuning on small, high-quality datasets. Multi-feature conditioning and window attention enhance synchronization.

Result: The method reduces manual effort by over 10x and generalizes to open classes, validated on the AVSync48 benchmark (48 classes).

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm efficiently scales audio-synchronized animation while minimizing human curation, leveraging pretrained models for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

*Mamadou Keita,Wassim Hamidouche,Hessen Bougueffa Eutamene,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed,Abdenour Hadid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAVID is a novel framework for detecting AI-generated images using visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods lack generalization and robustness, relying on low-level artifacts. RAVID addresses this by leveraging visual RAG to enhance detection.

Method: RAVID uses a fine-tuned CLIP encoder (RAVID CLIP) with category-related prompts and integrates a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the query for enriched input.

Result: RAVID achieves 93.85% accuracy on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark and maintains 80.27% accuracy under image degradations, outperforming C2P-CLIP (63.44%).

Conclusion: RAVID sets a new standard for AI-generated image detection, offering superior accuracy and robustness, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Michele Andrade,Guilherme A. L. Silva,ValÃ©ria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of pre-training datasets on deep learning models for estimating food nutrition from 2D images, finding proprietary datasets outperform public ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nutritional estimation from images is challenging due to variability in food presentation and lack of depth information. Reproducibility is limited by reliance on proprietary datasets.

Method: Fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on ImageNet and COYO, compared with CNN baselines (InceptionV2, ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method using JFT-300M. Evaluated on Nutrition5k dataset.

Result: JFT-300M pre-trained models outperformed public dataset models. COYO pre-training performed worse than ImageNet, contrary to expectations.

Conclusion: Pre-training dataset characteristics (scale, domain relevance, curation) are crucial for effective transfer learning in nutritional estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

*Zheng Zhang,Tianzhuzi Tan,Guanchun Yin,Bo Zhang,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusNet is a data augmentation framework for 3D medical image segmentation that preserves anatomical continuity while focusing on hard-to-segment regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data augmentation disrupts anatomical continuity in 3D medical images, causing structural inconsistencies and poor performance in challenging regions like small organs.

Method: JanusNet uses Slice-Block Shuffle to preserve anatomical context and Confidence-Guided Displacement to amplify signals from difficult areas.

Result: JanusNet achieves a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: JanusNet effectively combines global anatomical modeling with local focus on hard regions, improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing slow CAD rendering and expensive VLMs in Text-to-CAD systems, which can degrade performance due to reward hacking.

Method: Uses Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) for fast reward signals and Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM) for verification, alongside an agentic CAD generation approach.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAD datasets while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge effectively optimizes Text-to-CAD systems, enhancing both utility and robustness.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SÂ²Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for video diffusion models (V-DMs) to reduce computational costs by leveraging salient data and sparse token distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers for video generation are computationally expensive due to large parameter counts. Quantization can help but faces challenges like high calibration variance and learning difficulties from long token sequences.

Method: Proposes Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection for high-quality calibration datasets and Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation to focus on influential tokens.

Result: Achieves lossless performance under W4A6 quantization, with 3.9Ã model compression and 1.3Ã inference acceleration.

Conclusion: SÂ²Q-VDiT effectively addresses quantization challenges in V-DMs, offering significant efficiency gains without performance loss.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISEval, a framework to evaluate Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) ability to detect flawed inputs, revealing their struggles and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs, a gap in current research.

Method: Developed ISEval, a framework with seven categories of flawed premises and three metrics, evaluated on ten advanced LMMs.

Result: Most models fail to detect flawed inputs without guidance, with performance varying by error type and modality trust.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to improve LMMs' proactive input verification and offers insights for mitigation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDSSNet improves semantic segmentation in remote sensing by addressing intra-class variance and inter-class similarity through adaptive prototypes and semantic-structure coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to unify class representations or distinguish similar features, leading to incomplete segmentation. Class-guided approaches also lack fine-grained prototypes and structural awareness.

Method: PDSSNet uses three modules: APEM for unbiased class prototypes, SSCM for hierarchical semantic-structure coordination, and CSAM for dynamic feature adjustment.

Result: PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: PDSSNet effectively combines invariant semantics and variant structures for precise segmentation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Motivation: The challenge lies in adapting prompt learning for Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) due to difficulties in discriminating fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories.

Method: DCAR dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from semantic and visual dimensions, optimizing attribute and class features through text-image mutual information and category-matching weighting.

Result: DCAR outperforms existing baselines on the Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), showcasing superior performance.

Conclusion: DCAR effectively enhances fine-grained representation learning in ITR, validated by its success on the challenging FDRD benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

### [31] [Radar-Based NLoS Pedestrian Localization for Darting-Out Scenarios Near Parked Vehicles with Camera-Assisted Point Cloud Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04033)
*Hee-Yeun Kim,Byeonggyu Park,Byonghyok Choi,Hansang Cho,Byungkwan Kim,Soomok Lee,Mingu Jeon,Seung-Woo Seo,Seong-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an NLoS pedestrian localization framework combining monocular camera and 2D radar PCD to detect pedestrians obscured by parked vehicles, improving road safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of NLoS blind spots caused by parked vehicles, which hinder pedestrian detection and road safety.

Method: Integrates monocular camera image segmentation for parked vehicle detection and depth estimation, refined with 2D radar PCD for precise spatial inference.

Result: Demonstrates enhanced early pedestrian detection in real-world urban road environments.

Conclusion: The framework improves NLoS pedestrian localization, contributing to safer urban road conditions.

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Motivation: To improve Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in Person, Vehicle, and Object ReID by addressing domain gaps and enhancing feature representation.

Method: Uses CycleGAN for pre-training to synthesize diverse data and an ensemble fusion mechanism (ECAB/SECAB) during fine-tuning for better feature representation and pseudo-label clarity.

Result: Achieves top performance in mAP and Rank-k accuracy on UDA ReID datasets and supports lightweight backbones like ResNet18/34.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2 advances UDA-based Object ReID, providing a scalable and efficient framework for further research.

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingling Liu,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPJFNet addresses efficiency bottlenecks in dark image restoration by eliminating external priors, optimizing frequency processing, and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods suffer from inefficiency due to reliance on external priors, redundant operations, and indiscriminate frequency processing.

Method: SPJFNet uses a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) for lightweight endogenous guidance and a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) for efficient high/low frequency processing.

Result: SPJFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity and computational demands.

Conclusion: SPJFNet offers a more efficient and effective solution for dark image restoration, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualTrans is a new benchmark for Visual Transformation Reasoning (VTR) in real-world human-object interactions, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. It includes 12 tasks, 6 subtask types, and 472 QA pairs, evaluating spatial, procedural, and quantitative reasoning. State-of-the-art models perform well in static tasks but struggle with dynamic, multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTR benchmarks have a sim-to-real gap, limited complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, hindering practical use. VisualTrans aims to fill these gaps by focusing on real-world human-object interactions.

Method: The benchmark is built using a scalable pipeline: task selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with multimodal models, and structured question generation, followed by human verification.

Result: Models excel in static spatial tasks but show weaknesses in dynamic, multi-step reasoning, especially in intermediate state recognition and sequence planning.

Conclusion: VisualTrans highlights gaps in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, guiding future research for more capable VTR systems. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

*Qiangguo Jin,Hui Cui,Junbo Wang,Changming Sun,Yimiao He,Ping Xuan,Linlin Wang,Cong Cong,Leyi Wei,Ran Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPA-CP, a semi-supervised learning method for tumor segmentation in CT scans, addressing challenges like small tumors and underutilized data augmentation. It combines uncertainty-based adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-labeling to outperform existing SSL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods focus on large organs, neglecting small or numerous tumors, and lack thorough investigation of data augmentation strategies for labeled and unlabeled data.

Method: IPA-CP uses a two-way uncertainty-based adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-label transition to enhance tumor segmentation in CT scans.

Result: Experiments show IPA-CP outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: IPA-CP is a robust and effective SSL approach for tumor segmentation, particularly in challenging scenarios with small or numerous tumors.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

### [36] [Motion is the Choreographer: Learning Latent Pose Dynamics for Seamless Sign Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04049)
*Jiayi He,Xu Wang,Shengeng Tang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method for sign language video generation decouples motion semantics from signer identity, enabling high-quality synthesis with minimal data and flexible signer personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of excessive data requirements and poor generalization in sign language video generation by separating motion from identity.

Method: A two-phase framework: (1) building a signer-independent motion lexicon, and (2) transforming gloss sequences into motion trajectories with identity-aware rendering.

Result: Disentangling motion from identity improves synthesis quality and allows flexible personalization of signers.

Conclusion: The approach is viable and advantageous, offering high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

### [37] [DOMR: Establishing Cross-View Segmentation via Dense Object Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04050)
*Jitong Liao,Yulu Gao,Shaofei Huang,Jialin Gao,Jie Lei,Ronghua Liang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DOMR framework for dense object matching between egocentric and exocentric views, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence is crucial for visual understanding but challenging due to differences in perspectives.

Method: The DOMR framework includes a Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module that jointly models objects using positional and semantic relationships, and a mask refinement head for improved accuracy.

Result: DOMR achieves mean IoU scores of 49.7% (EgoâExo) and 55.2% (ExoâEgo), outperforming previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of DOMR effectively addresses cross-view object matching, validated by superior benchmark results.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

### [38] [Towards Globally Predictable k-Space Interpolation: A White-box Transformer Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04051)
*Chen Luo,Qiyu Jin,Taofeng Xie,Xuemei Wang,Huayu Wang,Congcong Liu,Liming Tang,Guoqing Chen,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Dong Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework for k-space interpolation in MRI, combining global dependencies and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for k-space interpolation focus on local predictability, ignoring global dependencies. Transformers, though effective in capturing long-range dependencies, lack interpretability.

Method: The authors introduce GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer based on Globally Predictable Interpolation (GPI), formulated as a structured low-rank model. It uses learnable global annihilation filters and subgradient-based optimization to create an interpretable attention mechanism.

Result: GPI-WT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in k-space interpolation accuracy and offers superior interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed GPI-WT framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging global dependencies and ensuring interpretability in accelerated MRI.

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff is a unified, scalable document restoration model using diffusion, with learnable task prompts and a Prior Pool mechanism for multi-task synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and complexity of independent models for document restoration tasks by proposing a unified solution.

Method: Uses diffusion-based architecture with learnable task prompts, Prior Pool for feature combination, and Prior Fusion Module for adaptive task-specific prior selection.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific models while maintaining scalability for new tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff offers a scalable, efficient, and high-performing solution for multi-task document restoration.

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCSAFormer is a transformer-based medical image segmentation network that reduces computational complexity and enhances local and multiscale feature capture, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods for medical image segmentation face high computational costs and limited local feature capture, prompting the need for an efficient solution.

Method: TCSAFormer uses a Compressed Attention module for dynamic token focus and a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network for local and multiscale feature extraction.

Result: TCSAFormer achieves superior performance on ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse datasets with lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: TCSAFormer effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in medical image segmentation, addressing key limitations of existing transformer-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces O-Bench, a VQA benchmark for occlusion perception, revealing a performance gap between MLLMs and humans, with identified failure patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate the under-explored occlusion perception capabilities of MLLMs, addressing a critical gap in spatial understanding.

Method: Developed O-Bench using a layered synthesis approach on SA-1B, annotating 4,588 QA pairs across five tasks, and evaluating 22 MLLMs against human baselines.

Result: A significant performance gap between MLLMs and humans was found, not bridged by scaling or reasoning. Three failure patterns were identified.

Conclusion: O-Bench serves as a vital tool for evaluating occlusion perception and inspires improvements in MLLMs for visual intelligence.

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

*Chengqian Dai,Yonghong Guo,Hongzhao Xiang,Yigui Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TNet introduces a Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network to enhance global-local feature interactions in remote sensing segmentation, outperforming benchmarks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing networks focus on intra-scale relationships, neglecting global contextual dependencies across resolutions.

Method: TNet uses convolution and addition to progressively integrate low-resolution (global context) into high-resolution (local details) features.

Result: Achieves mIoU of 85.35% (Vaihingen), 87.05% (Potsdam), and 52.19% (LoveDA) with high efficiency.

Conclusion: TNet effectively blends global and local information, offering competitive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 3DSR is a 3D Gaussian-splatting-based super-resolution framework using 2D diffusion models, ensuring 3D consistency without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-resolution 3D reconstructions with explicit 3D consistency, unlike prior methods that lack or implicitly handle it.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion models for super-resolution within a 3D Gaussian-splatting framework, ensuring spatial coherence.

Result: Produces visually compelling high-resolution results on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data, maintaining 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: 3DSR effectively enhances visual quality and 3D consistency without additional fine-tuning, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with accurate geometric reconstruction in sparse-view scenarios due to noise sensitivity and poor preservation of fine structures and boundaries.

Result: DET-GS outperforms SOTA methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity on sparse-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: DET-GS effectively addresses challenges in sparse-view reconstruction, offering superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

### [45] [NEARL-CLIP: Interacted Query Adaptation with Orthogonal Regularization for Medical Vision-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04101)
*Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Yu Huang,Piao Yang,Feilong Tang,Zhengqin Xu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEARL-CLIP proposes a cross-modality interaction framework for medical image analysis, addressing domain gaps in VLMs with dynamic query generation and orthogonality techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated medical datasets and domain gaps hinder the application of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP in medical imaging. Existing methods often misalign modalities.

Method: NEARL-CLIP introduces USEformer for dynamic cross-modality queries and OCA for orthogonality-based knowledge decoupling, enabling efficient parameter use (1.46M).

Result: The framework enhances multi-modal interaction and knowledge enrichment, improving VLM performance in medical imaging.

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP effectively bridges the domain gap in medical VLMs, unlocking their potential with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

TL;DR: ARCADE is an AR-based platform designed to simplify human perception studies for CV model evaluation, offering cross-platform data collection, custom protocols, and AR streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception studies are valuable but complex and hard to scale; AR offers a unique opportunity to streamline this process.

Method: ARCADE leverages AR for data collection, pluggable model inference, and AR streaming to facilitate human-centered CV evaluation.

Result: ARCADE effectively elicits human judgments on CV model quality (e.g., depth and lighting estimation) and demonstrates usability across settings.

Conclusion: ARCADE is a flexible and effective tool for human-centered CV evaluation, showcasing AR's potential in perceptual studies.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

*Jingchao Wang,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang,Yefeng Zheng,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMSeg is a lightweight framework for Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) that leverages MLLM features without extra encoders, balancing performance and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RES methods either use heavy models like SAM or lightweight pipelines with accuracy trade-offs. MLLMSeg aims to address this imbalance.

Method: MLLMSeg utilizes MLLM's visual encoder for detail features and introduces a feature fusion module (DSFF) to combine visual and semantic features. A lightweight mask decoder (34M parameters) predicts masks.

Result: MLLMSeg outperforms SAM-based and SAM-free methods, achieving better performance-cost balance.

Conclusion: MLLMSeg offers an efficient solution for RES by integrating MLLM features and a lightweight decoder, improving accuracy without heavy computational costs.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

*Likai Wang,Ruize Han,Xiangqun Zhang,Wei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIPVehicle, a unified framework for joint vehicle detection and re-identification, addressing the conflict between detection and Re-ID objectives. It leverages VLMs and multi-level learning, validated on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vehicle search are resource-intensive and impractical due to separate detection and Re-ID steps. The paper aims to unify these tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes CLIPVehicle with dual-granularity semantic-region alignment and multi-level learning (global, instance, feature). Introduces new datasets: CityFlowVS, SynVS-Day, SynVS-All.

Result: CLIPVehicle outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies detection and Re-ID, demonstrating superior performance and practicality for vehicle search.

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OC-DiT is a diffusion model for zero-shot instance segmentation, using conditional latent diffusion to generate instance masks from object templates and image features. It achieves state-of-the-art performance without target data retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of zero-shot instance segmentation by leveraging diffusion models to disentangle object instances using visual descriptors and localized cues.

Method: Proposes a conditional latent diffusion framework with two variants: a coarse model for initial proposals and a refinement model for parallel refinement. Trained on a synthetic dataset of object meshes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks without retraining on target data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of diffusion models for instance segmentation, validated through ablation studies.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

*Zheng Cheng,Wenri Wang,Guangyong Chen,Yakun Ju,Yihua Cheng,Zhisong Liu,Yanda Meng,Jintao Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the necessity of multi-scale feature fusion in underwater image enhancement, proposing a single-scale approach (SSD-Net) that matches or outperforms multi-scale methods while reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UIE methods rely on multi-scale feature fusion, but experiments show single-scale extraction can achieve similar or better results with lower complexity.

Method: Proposes SSD-Net, using asymmetrical decomposition to separate clean and degradation layers, combining CNN and Transformer strengths via PFDB and BFCB modules.

Result: SSD-Net effectively decouples degradation, enhancing image quality without multi-scale fusion, reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Single-scale feature extraction is viable for UIE, offering a simpler yet effective alternative to multi-scale methods.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning approach combines privileged information with object detection to improve litter detection, maintaining efficiency and generalizing well across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global rise in litter pollution by enhancing automated detection tools, especially for small or obscured litter.

Method: Combines privileged information with deep learning object detection, encodes bounding box info as binary masks, and evaluates across five models.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across models, better generalization, and maintained computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, efficient solution for litter detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge to address cross-domain generalization in deception detection, leveraging multimodal data for adaptable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deception detection methods suffer from domain shifts and lack cross-domain generalization, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The challenge involves developing models using multimodal data (audio, video, text) to detect deception across diverse datasets.

Result: 21 teams participated, submitting results to evaluate cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: The challenge aims to advance adaptable, explainable, and deployable deception detection systems, promoting multimodal learning.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

*Zhaohong Huang,Yuxin Zhang,Mingbao Lin,Taojian Zhou,Guorong Cai,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSÂ²Net introduces multi-view deep supervision for medical image segmentation, combining detail and semantic feature supervision with an adaptive uncertainty-based loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods supervise coarse-grained or fine-grained features in isolation, ignoring their vital relationships in medical image analysis.

Method: Proposes DSÂ²Net with Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM) for multi-view supervision, plus an adaptive uncertainty-based loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmarks across colonoscopy, ultrasound, and microscope imaging.

Conclusion: DSÂ²Net's multi-view supervision and adaptive loss design significantly improve medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

*Hongyu Guo,Kuan Zhu,Xiangzhao Hao,Haiyun Guo,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFGVC is a training-free framework for few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that reformulates the task as multimodal retrieval, leveraging structured text descriptions and multimodal templates for improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from overfitting and weak generalization when finetuning pre-trained models for few-shot FGVC. UniFGVC addresses this by avoiding training and using multimodal retrieval.

Method: UniFGVC uses a Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to generate structured text descriptions from images, constructs multimodal templates, and performs retrieval in a joint vision-text space.

Result: Outperforms prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and some fully-supervised approaches on 12 FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniFGVC offers reliable generalization and adaptability, making it a strong solution for few-shot FGVC.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDC-Net is a unified framework for generating RGB-D video sequences with precise camera control, combining RGB and depth synthesis in a geometry-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat RGB and depth generation separately, lacking spatial and geometric alignment. IDC-Net aims to unify these processes for better camera control and geometric fidelity.

Method: IDC-Net jointly synthesizes RGB images and depth maps using a geometry-aware diffusion model, trained on a dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth maps, and camera poses. A geometry-aware transformer block enhances camera control.

Result: IDC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and geometric consistency, enabling direct use in 3D scene reconstruction without post-processing.

Conclusion: The joint learning framework of IDC-Net improves RGB-D sequence generation, offering practical benefits for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM-Fusion combines meta-learning and in-context adaptation to enhance multi-task generalization in LoRA models, reducing conflicts and forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods cause inter-weight conflicts and domain forgetting, especially in few-shot or long-tailed scenarios.

Method: ICM-Fusion uses task vector arithmetic and a Fusion VAE to dynamically balance optimization directions and reconstruct fused LoRA.

Result: ICM-Fusion reduces multi-tasking loss and enhances performance in few-shot scenarios across visual and linguistic tasks.

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion is a versatile framework that improves LoRA fusion for multi-task adaptation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

TL;DR: GAVN is a network for restoring degraded face videos using audio and visual correlations, outperforming existing methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face videos often suffer from degradations, and existing methods neglect visual-audio correlations, especially in mouth regions.

Method: GAVN uses identity and temporal complementary learning: coarse restoration in low-resolution space, detailed restoration with audio and landmarks, and feature integration for high-quality output.

Result: GAVN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.

Conclusion: GAVN effectively restores face videos by leveraging audio-visual correlations and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of 6,300 memes annotated for toxicity and proposes a tag generation module to enhance meme moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media amplifies toxic discourse, and memes spread harmful content, but dataset limitations hinder moderation development.

Method: A two-stage annotation process (binary and fine-grained) and a tag generation module for context enrichment.

Result: Incorporating socially grounded tags improves detection performance in state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable foundation for better content moderation in multimodal online spaces.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

*Jingyi Liao,Yongyi Su,Rong-Cheng Tu,Zhao Jin,Wenhao Sun,Yiting Li,Dacheng Tao,Xun Xu,Xulei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to improve Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for specialized anomaly detection by introducing deliberative reasoning and fine-grained rewards, achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for anomaly detection using MLLMs face challenges like poor data utilization and lack of supervision over reasoning, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The framework includes a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process and a fine-grained reward mechanism to enhance model performance.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches, improving accuracy and adaptation to specialized anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between general MLLM capabilities and the demands of fine-grained anomaly detection.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

*Jin Kuang,Dong Liu,Yukuang Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U2CLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement, integrating uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color causal correlation modeling to address feature uncertainty and noise dominance in dark conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook feature uncertainty and noise dominance in extremely dark conditions, impairing model reliability and causal reasoning.

Method: U2CLLIE includes an Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module for noise suppression and a hierarchical causality-aware framework with Luminance Enhancement Network (LEN) and causal correlation modules (NeCo and AsC).

Result: U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, showing robustness and generalization across scenes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates gradient vanishing and noise dominance, enhancing low-light images with improved reliability and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

*Sungrae Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the practical utility and training stability of the ViT-22B model, proposing modifications for stability and exploring its performance and image generation capabilities compared to ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical utility and training behavior of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B, addressing instability and exploring new tasks like image generation.

Method: Analyzes ViT-22B's training in local environments, modifies the model for stability, compares performance with ViT, and investigates image generation suitability.

Result: ViT-22B outperforms ViT under the same parameter size and shows potential for image generation, though stability issues were noted.

Conclusion: ViT-22B is promising for performance and new tasks like image generation, but requires stability improvements for broader practical use.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

### [62] [RPCANet++: Deep Interpretable Robust PCA for Sparse Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04190)
*Fengyi Wu,Yimian Dai,Tianfang Zhang,Yixuan Ding,Jian Yang,Ming-Ming Cheng,Zhenming Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPCANet++ integrates RPCA with deep learning for efficient and interpretable sparse object segmentation, outperforming traditional RPCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RPCA models are computationally heavy, require fine-tuned hyperparameters, and lack adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: RPCANet++ unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a network with Background Approximation, Object Extraction, and Image Restoration Modules, enhanced by Memory-Augmented and Deep Contrast Prior Modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets, with improved interpretability via low-rankness and sparsity measurements.

Conclusion: RPCANet++ combines RPCA's theoretical strengths with deep learning efficiency, setting a new benchmark for sparse object segmentation.

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

### [63] [From Learning to Unlearning: Biomedical Security Protection in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04192)
*Dunyuan Xu,Xikai Yang,Yaoqian Li,Jinpeng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLMU-Med, the first benchmark for evaluating unlearning in biomedical MLLMs, addressing privacy and incorrect knowledge issues. It highlights limited effectiveness of current unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical MLLMs risk privacy leaks and errors due to undetected harmful training data. Retraining is impractical, so machine unlearning is proposed as a solution, but lacks evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Developed MLLMU-Med, a benchmark with synthetic private data and factual errors, targeting privacy protection and incorrectness removal. Introduced an Unlearning Efficiency Score.

Result: Evaluated five unlearning methods, finding limited effectiveness in removing harmful knowledge, showing room for improvement.

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med provides a foundation for future research in biomedical MLLM unlearning, addressing critical security gaps.

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

### [64] [Gather and Trace: Rethinking Video TextVQA from an Instance-oriented Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04197)
*Yan Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Daiqing Wu,Huawen Shen,Binbin Li,Yu Zhou,Can Ma,Xiaojun Bi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAT (Gather and Trace) improves Video TextVQA by focusing on instance-oriented text reading and dynamic evolution, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frame-level frameworks for Video TextVQA suffer from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: GAT uses a context-aggregated instance gathering module for unified text representation and an instance-focused trajectory tracing module for spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: GAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 3.86% in accuracy and is ten times faster than video large language models.

Conclusion: GAT effectively addresses limitations in Video TextVQA, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

*Wengang Guo,Wei Ye,Chunchun Chen,Xin Sun,Christian BÃ¶hm,Claudia Plant,Susanto Rahardja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BootSC is a deep spectral clustering model that jointly optimizes all stages of spectral clustering end-to-end, addressing disjoint optimization and limited representation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the disjoint optimization and limited representation capacity in traditional spectral clustering.

Method: Jointly learns affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and k-means clustering using a single network with optimal-transport-derived supervision and orthogonal re-parameterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 16% NMI improvement on ImageNet-Dogs.

Conclusion: BootSC effectively integrates spectral clustering stages and enhances performance through end-to-end learning and novel techniques.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrEVL explores using frozen pretrained embeddings for vision-language tasks, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of vision-language models by leveraging frozen embeddings for efficient deployment.

Method: Analyzes frozen embeddings' effectiveness, focusing on alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, and evaluates performance, speed, and energy efficiency.

Result: Frozen embeddings achieve 85-95% of state-of-the-art performance with 68.4M parameters, offering 2.3Ã speedup and 52% lower energy use.

Conclusion: FrEVL is a viable alternative for efficient deployment when computational constraints outweigh minor performance gains, with guidelines for practitioners.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

### [67] [ViFP: A Framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04201)
*Ben Zhang,LuLu Yu,Lei Gao,Jing Liu,QuanJiang Guo,Hui Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViFP is a framework to improve visual-language model reasoning by detecting false positives (FPs) and enhancing reasoning paths, achieving higher accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False positive reasoning in VLMs, where correct answers stem from incorrect paths, limits reliability. Existing methods are costly and lack generalization.

Method: ViFP uses sub-question templates and multi-turn QA to build sound reasoning paths, detects FPs via consistency analysis, and employs adaptive CoT.

Result: ViFP boosts accuracy by up to 5.4% on A-OKVQA, reduces FPs, and outperforms prior methods.

Conclusion: ViFP enhances VLM reasoning reliability and accuracy, validated by improved performance and a new metric (VoC).

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

### [68] [Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination: A Training Bias Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04567)
*Yifan Li,Kun Zhou,Wayne Xin Zhao,Lei Fang,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates training data's role in hallucination issues of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), introduces POPEv2 benchmark, identifies training bias in LM heads, and proposes Obliviate, an efficient unlearning method to reduce hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucination (text inconsistent with visuals), motivating a study on training data's role in this issue.

Method: Introduces POPEv2 benchmark with counterfactual images, probes model internals, and proposes Obliviate, a lightweight unlearning method targeting the LM head.

Result: Obliviate reduces hallucination significantly, updates only 2% of parameters, and scales well with model size and data volume.

Conclusion: Obliviate effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating scalability and generalization, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MMCAF-Net, a multimodal multiscale cross-attention fusion network, to improve medical disease diagnosis by addressing dimensionality differences between imaging and EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in diagnosing small lesions and dimensionality differences in multimodal medical data.

Method: Uses a feature pyramid and 3D multi-scale convolutional attention for lesion-specific feature extraction, plus a cross-attention module for fusion.

Result: Achieves higher diagnostic accuracy on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset than current methods.

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net effectively addresses multimodal data fusion challenges, improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies bottlenecks in open-vocabulary segmentation models and proposes oracle components to address them, offering insights for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-vocabulary models fail to recognize concepts outside training taxonomies, and performance has stagnated for years.

Method: Proposes novel oracle components leveraging groundtruth information to identify and decouple bottlenecks.

Result: Validation experiments reveal empirical findings about open-vocabulary model failures.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and approaches to advance future open-vocabulary segmentation research.

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplitGaussian decouples static and dynamic scene components for improved 3D reconstruction from monocular video, enhancing quality and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods entangle static and dynamic elements, causing motion leakage and distortions.

Method: Proposes SplitGaussian, explicitly separating static and dynamic components, with dynamic elements deforming over time.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion separation.

Conclusion: Disentangled design improves temporal consistency, fidelity, and convergence speed.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on continual learning for vision-language models (VLM-CL), addressing challenges like catastrophic forgetting and proposing solutions like multi-modal replay, cross-modal regularization, and parameter-efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unique challenges of continual learning in VLMs, such as cross-modal feature drift and zero-shot capability erosion, which degrade performance.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of solutions: multi-modal replay strategies, cross-modal regularization, and parameter-efficient adaptation. Analyzes evaluation protocols and datasets.

Result: Identifies core failure modes in VLM-CL and maps solutions to these challenges, highlighting the need for better benchmarks.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a reference for developing lifelong VLMs, with open problems like continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

*Kangrui Cen,Baixuan Zhao,Yi Xin,Siqi Luo,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerT2V introduces a layered approach for Text-to-Video (T2V) generation to handle multi-object motion, improving performance in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models struggle with multi-object motion and intersecting trajectories due to semantic conflicts, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: LayerT2V composites background and foreground objects layer by layer, enabling independent control and coherent synthesis of multiple objects.

Result: LayerT2V outperforms SOTA methods with 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics.

Conclusion: LayerT2V provides a scalable solution for multi-object T2V generation, enhancing control and performance in complex scenes.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based model for pedestrian trajectory prediction incorporates motion intentions, improving interpretability and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but existing models often overlook motion intentions, limiting performance.

Method: The model decomposes motion intentions into lateral and longitudinal components, uses an intention recognition module, and employs an efficient guidance mechanism.

Result: Evaluated on ETH and UCY benchmarks, the model achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion intentions enhances the interpretability and precision of pedestrian trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

*Saifullah Saifullah,Stefan Agne,Andreas Dengel,Sheraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocVCE, a novel method using generative counterfactuals to explain document image classification models, addressing interpretability gaps in existing feature-importance maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving transparency and reliability of AI-driven document processing systems, especially in high-stakes applications where biases or spurious correlations can have serious consequences.

Method: Proposes DocVCE, leveraging latent diffusion models and classifier guidance to generate visual counterfactual explanations, followed by hierarchical patch-wise refinement.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on three datasets (RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, DocLayNet) and three models (ResNet, ConvNeXt, DiT) using validity, closeness, and realism metrics.

Conclusion: First work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis, providing actionable insights into model decisions.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

TL;DR: The paper explores using CNNs for classifying objects in SAR data, comparing simulated and reconstructed images, and applies this to identify ice types in real SAR imagery, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage CNNs for accurate classification of objects and ice types in SAR data, addressing challenges in geometric and environmental classification.

Method: Uses a single scattering approximation with CNNs, comparing simulated SAR data and reconstructed images, and tests on real Sentinel-1 SAR imagery.

Result: Achieves high classification accuracy (â¥75%) in both simulated and real SAR data experiments.

Conclusion: CNNs are effective for SAR-based classification tasks, and antenna height impacts classification success.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and
classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to
classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

*Muhua Zhu,Xinhao Jin,Chengbo Wang,Yongcong Zhang,Yifei Xue,Tie Ji,Yizhen Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIS3R is a novel image stitching method using deep 3D reconstruction to handle large parallax, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stitching methods struggle with large parallax due to depth variations and significant camera baselines.

Method: Uses a transformer for 3D scene reconstruction, reprojects point clouds for alignment, and refines results with a diffusion module.

Result: Accurate stitching for large parallax, preserving geometric integrity and outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: PIS3R is robust for large parallax and suitable for downstream 3D tasks like SfM.

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from
relying on direct human observation to more nuanced approaches integrating

While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the
complexity of rodent social interactions, modern approaches bridging computer

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAV, a framework for vehicle part segmentation using SAM, a knowledge graph, and a retrieval module, and introduces a new dataset, VehicleSeg10K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models like SAM lack semantic labels and fine-grained capabilities for vehicle part segmentation, limiting their practical use.

Method: SAV combines a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph for spatial relationships, and a context retrieval module for improved segmentation.

Result: The framework is tested on VehicleSeg10K and other datasets, showing improved performance and generalization.

Conclusion: SAV addresses SAM's limitations for vehicle part segmentation, offering a robust solution and a new benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

### [80] [Revisiting Continual Semantic Segmentation with Pre-trained Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04267)
*Duzhen Zhang,Yong Ren,Wei Cong,Junhao Zheng,Qiaoyi Su,Shuncheng Jia,Zhong-Zhi Li,Xuanle Zhao,Ye Bai,Feilong Chen,Qi Tian,Tielin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT) in Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) suffers from severe forgetting. It demonstrates that Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs) retain knowledge well under DFT, and proposes DFT*, a simple enhancement that outperforms complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reevaluate the assumption that DFT in CSS is highly prone to catastrophic forgetting and to explore the actual anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs.

Method: Systematically revisits forgetting in DFT across benchmarks (Pascal VOC 2012, ADE20K) using ResNet101 and Swin-B backbones. Proposes DFT*, which freezes the PVM backbone and pre-allocates classifiers.

Result: PVMs retain knowledge well under DFT; forgetting is due to classifier drift, not backbone degradation. DFT* outperforms 16 state-of-the-art CSS methods with fewer parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: DFT* is a simple yet effective solution for CSS, leveraging PVMs' inherent anti-forgetting capabilities and outperforming complex methods.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

*Chenlei Lv,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PKSS-Align is a robust point cloud registration method handling similarity transformations, noise, and defects without training or complex features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration is sensitive to transformations, noise, and defects, often leading to local optima. PKSS-Align addresses these challenges.

Method: Uses Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS) for shape feature-based similarity, avoiding point-to-point metrics. It directly generates transformation matrices.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency, with no need for data training.

Conclusion: PKSS-Align is efficient, practical, and robust for point cloud registration under various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of novel view synthesis across diverse baseline settings, including sparse inputs with varying baselines.

Method: Integrates MVS and MDE features, employs projection-and-sampling for depth fusion, and uses 3D Gaussian representations for efficiency.

Conclusion: MuRF generalizes well across diverse scenarios, offering efficient training and high-quality rendering.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized
feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse
baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large
baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple
objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also
demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LATR, a Length-Aware Transformer for Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), improving query specialization by leveraging length priors to reduce redundancy and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of explicit supervision in DETR-based TSG models causes overlapping query roles and redundant predictions, necessitating a method to specialize queries based on temporal lengths.

Method: LATR divides queries into three groups (short, middle, long durations) and introduces a length classification task during training to suppress mismatched predictions, ensuring query specialization.

Result: LATR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the importance of length priors.

Conclusion: Incorporating length priors into TSG via LATR effectively reduces redundancy and improves localization accuracy, validating the method's design.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAEPD, a foundational model for DAS signal recognition using a Masked Autoencoder, pretrained on diverse datasets and fine-tuned with Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) for efficient downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data distribution disparities and limited labeled training data in DAS applications to improve cross-domain generalization.

Method: Pretrains MAEPD on 635,860 diverse DAS samples using self-supervised mask reconstruction, then employs VPT for downstream tasks, freezing backbone and fine-tuning minimal parameters.

Result: Achieves 96.94% accuracy in gait recognition with 0.322% fine-tuned parameters, outperforming Full Fine Tuning by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%.

Conclusion: MAEPD demonstrates generality, efficiency, and scalability, offering a novel paradigm for DAS signal recognition.

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

TL;DR: TempFlow-GRPO improves text-to-image generation by addressing temporal uniformity in reward assignment, using trajectory branching and noise-aware weighting for better alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching models struggle with fine-grained reward optimization due to uniform credit assignment, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence.

Method: TempFlow-GRPO introduces trajectory branching for process rewards and noise-aware weighting to modulate policy optimization based on timestep criticality.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: TempFlow-GRPO effectively addresses temporal uniformity, enhancing optimization and performance in flow-based generation.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

TL;DR: RiemanLine introduces a unified minimal representation for 3D lines on Riemannian manifolds, accommodating both individual lines and parallel-line groups, improving accuracy and reducing parameter dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representations overlook structural regularities like parallel lines in man-made environments, limiting efficiency and accuracy in camera localization and structural mapping.

Method: Decouples lines into global (vanishing direction on unit sphere) and local (scaled normal vectors) components, reducing parameter space for parallel lines. Integrated into a factor graph for manifold-based bundle adjustment.

Result: Achieves more accurate pose estimation and line reconstruction, reduces parameter dimensionality, and improves convergence stability in experiments.

Conclusion: RiemanLine provides a compact, efficient representation for 3D lines, enhancing performance in structured environments.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RotatedMVPS improves shape and reflectance recovery under natural light by using a rotation stage and integrating learning-based priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPS methods require controlled settings or neglect reflectance/illumination recovery, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses a rotation stage for light consistency and integrates learning-based single-view priors into MVPS.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS enhances accuracy and applicability in natural illumination scenarios.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPO uses reinforcement learning to optimize sparse frame sampling in MLLMs for long videos, improving event capture and language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video MLLMs struggle with critical event capture and training challenges due to sparse frame sampling.

Method: Proposes TSPO, a reinforcement learning approach with an event-aware temporal agent and rule-based rewards for joint keyframe selection and language generation.

Result: TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on long video benchmarks and shows transferability across Video-MLLMs.

Conclusion: TSPO effectively addresses limitations in long-form video understanding for MLLMs through optimized temporal sampling.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge

*Lefei Shen,Mouxiang Chen,Xu Liu,Han Fu,Xiaoxue Ren,Jianling Sun,Zhuo Li,Chenghao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionTS++ bridges gaps in cross-modal transfer from vision to time series forecasting with innovations in data filtering, multivariate conversion, and probabilistic forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing key discrepancies between vision models and time series forecasting: data-modality, multivariate-forecasting, and probabilistic-forecasting gaps.

Method: Proposes VisionTS++ with three innovations: vision-model-based filtering, colorized multivariate conversion, and multi-quantile forecasting.

Result: Achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized models by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and leading in 9/12 probabilistic forecasting settings.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing universal time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

### [90] [ProtoN: Prototype Node Graph Neural Network for Unconstrained Multi-Impression Ear Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04381)
*Santhoshkumar Peddi,Sadhvik Bathini,Arun Balasubramanian,Monalisa Sarma,Debasis Samanta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoN, a few-shot learning framework, uses a graph-based approach with a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) to improve ear biometric recognition by jointly processing multiple impressions and enhancing discriminative power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ear biometrics face challenges like limited annotated data and high intra-class variability, restricting the effectiveness of existing methods that process impressions in isolation.

Method: ProtoN represents impressions as nodes in a class-specific graph with a learnable prototype node. PGNN refines representations via dual-path message-passing and cross-graph prototype alignment, using a hybrid loss for balanced classification.

Result: ProtoN achieves 99.60% Rank-1 accuracy and 0.025 EER on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ProtoN effectively addresses few-shot ear recognition challenges, demonstrating superior performance with limited data.

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

*Yinan Yu,Alex Gonzalez-Caceres,Samuel Scheidegger,Sanjay Somanath,Alexander Hollberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SI3FP is a pipeline for generating LoD3 thermal models from images, combining computer vision and deep learning to accurately identify building features like windows, with applications in energy renovation and urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-phase renovation planning requires accurate thermal 3D models (LoD3), but scalable and precise feature identification is challenging.

Method: SI3FP extracts geometries from images using computer vision and deep learning, directly modeling geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane to reduce distortions.

Result: Tested on Swedish buildings, SI3FP achieved ~5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, suitable for early-stage renovation analysis.

Conclusion: SI3FP enables scalable, accurate LoD3 model generation, supporting large-scale energy renovation and urban development.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

*Haoji Zhang,Xin Gu,Jiawen Li,Chixiang Ma,Sule Bai,Chubin Zhang,Bowen Zhang,Zhichao Zhou,Dongliang He,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITAL is a tool-augmented learning framework for video reasoning, improving cross-modal interaction and reducing hallucination in MLLMs. It uses a visual toolbox and multimodal CoT for precise reasoning, supported by new datasets and a DGRPO algorithm for multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based CoT methods for MLLMs struggle with cross-modal interaction and hallucination in long videos, limiting video reasoning performance.

Method: VITAL employs a visual toolbox for dense frame sampling and multimodal CoT. It introduces datasets (MTVR-CoT-72k, MTVR-RL-110k) and the DGRPO algorithm for balanced multi-task learning.

Result: VITAL outperforms existing methods on 11 benchmarks, excelling in long video scenarios for question answering and temporal grounding.

Conclusion: VITAL advances video reasoning in MLLMs, addressing key challenges with a novel framework, datasets, and optimization algorithm, with plans for public release.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

*Christian Bohn,Thomas Kurbiel,Klaus Friedrichs,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention method is proposed to address the computational inefficiency of Transformers in Multitask Learning, reducing FLOPs and latency while improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face computational limits in Multitask Learning due to quadratic scaling of attention matrices with task numbers, making them impractical for many queries.

Method: Introduces Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention to efficiently aggregate information across feature maps from different tasks.

Result: Achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in FLOPs and latency, with up to 7.4% improvement in task prediction quality on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency and performance in Multitask Learning with Transformers.

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

*Tong Wang,Guanyu Yang,Nian Liu,Zongyan Han,Jinxing Zhou,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a new task for object-level precision in multi-modal retrieval, and proposes CORE, a model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods lack object-level precision, limiting their ability to localize specific objects based on composed expressions.

Method: Proposes COR, a task for object-level retrieval, and CORE, a model integrating reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning.

Result: CORE significantly outperforms existing models, demonstrated on the COR127K benchmark with 127,166 retrieval triplets.

Conclusion: COR and CORE advance fine-grained multi-modal retrieval, providing a strong baseline and opening new research directions.

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

*Jonas Ammeling,Jonathan Ganz,Emely Rosbach,Ludwig Lausser,Christof A. Bertram,Katharina Breininger,Marc Aubreville*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models with LoRA adaptation outperform linear probing and nearly match full data performance with only 10% training data, while also improving robustness to unseen tumor domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitotic figure classification is critical for tumor grading, but labeled data is limited. Self-supervised foundation models can leverage unlabeled data to improve performance.

Method: Evaluated data scaling laws and robustness of foundation models for mitotic classification, comparing linear probing and LoRA adaptation against end-to-end-trained CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Result: LoRA-adapted foundation models achieve near-100% performance with 10% data and reduce out-of-domain performance gaps. Traditional fine-tuning remains competitive.

Conclusion: LoRA-adapted foundation models are highly efficient for mitotic classification, though traditional methods still hold value.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

*Qingguo Hu,Ante Wang,Jia Song,Delai Qiu,Qingsong Liu,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-improvement framework (CVC) for LVLMs to enhance visual perception by inferring masked objects based on causal relationships, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs lack deep visual perception due to limited visual knowledge in training corpora, hindering tasks like identifying subtle image differences.

Method: Proposes CVC, a visual knowledge-intensive task, using automated instance construction for self-improvement via trial and error learning.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements, averaging 5.4% and 4.0% gains on specialized tasks with LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively.

Conclusion: The CVC framework effectively enhances LVLMs' visual perception and reasoning, validated by performance boosts on specialized and comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

*Shuzhou Yang,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaoyu Li,Yaowei Li,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DVD is a cascaded video diffusion model that decouples 4D content generation into coarse layout prediction and structure-aware refinement, achieving high-quality dense-view videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly generating high-dimensional 4D data is complex, so 4DVD aims to simplify this by decoupling the task into manageable subtasks.

Method: 4DVD first predicts dense view layouts with cross-view and temporal consistency, then refines these with structure-aware spatio-temporal generation.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and 4D generation, enabling accurate 4D representations.

Conclusion: 4DVD effectively simplifies 4D generation and outperforms existing methods, with potential for wider practical applications.

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

*Hongxu Chen,Zhen Wang,Taoran Mei,Lin Li,Bowei Zhu,Runshi Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ErasePro is a novel closed-form method for concept erasure in text-to-image models, addressing limitations of incomplete erasure and quality degradation by introducing zero-residual constraints and progressive layer-wise updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for concept erasure in text-to-image models suffer from incomplete erasure and generation quality degradation due to non-zero alignment residuals and concentrated parameter updates in deep layers.

Method: ErasePro introduces a zero-residual constraint for perfect alignment and employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy to transfer target concept features to anchor concepts gradually.

Result: Empirical results show ErasePro's effectiveness in various concept erasure tasks, including instance, art style, and nudity erasure.

Conclusion: ErasePro improves concept erasure completeness and preserves generative quality, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVSR introduces a low-bit quantization model for video super-resolution (VSR) using spatio-temporal complexity awareness and learnable bias alignment to address slow processing and high resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for VSR are resource-intensive and slow, limiting practical use. Quantization is challenging due to temporal characteristics and fidelity needs.

Method: Proposes STCA mechanism to measure spatio-temporal complexities and allocate layer-specific ranks. Uses LBA module to reduce quantization errors. Jointly refines FP and low-bit branches.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-precision models and outperforms other low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: QuantVSR effectively balances performance and efficiency, making VSR models more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

*Panagiotis Alimisis,Christos Diou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Delta Embeddings for representing interventions in causal representation learning, improving OOD robustness without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal representation learning focuses on scene variables, neglecting intervention representations, which are key for OOD robustness.

Method: Proposes Causal Delta Embeddingsâinvariant to visual scenes and sparse in affected causal variablesâlearned from image pairs without supervision.

Result: Outperforms baselines in OOD settings on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as shown in the Causal Triplet challenge.

Conclusion: Focusing on intervention representations via Causal Delta Embeddings enhances OOD robustness effectively.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

TL;DR: MonoCloth reconstructs and animates clothed human avatars from monocular videos using a part-based decomposition strategy and a dedicated cloth simulation module, improving visual quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited geometric information and complex non-rigid motion in monocular videos make 3D human avatar reconstruction challenging.

Method: Part-based decomposition separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing, with detailed geometry recovery for face/hands and a cloth simulation module for garments.

Result: MonoCloth outperforms existing methods in visual reconstruction quality and animation realism, and supports tasks like clothing transfer.

Conclusion: MonoCloth's part-based design enhances reconstruction and animation, demonstrating versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

*Uzay GÃ¶kay,Federico Spurio,Dominik R. Bach,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method for skeleton-based temporal action segmentation using a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder and motion word quantization, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods focus on video data, neglecting skeleton sequences despite their practical advantages like robustness and privacy. Annotated data for supervised methods is costly.

Method: Uses a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder to disentangle joint information, divides latent sequences into patches, and quantizes them into motion words for action clustering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in unsupervised skeleton-based action segmentation, offering a practical and high-performing solution.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency and explainability in current deepfake detection methods, which rely on classification without clear rationale.

Method: Integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for external knowledge and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained explanations and saliency maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy and provides interpretable textual and visual explanations.

Conclusion: RAIDX successfully bridges gaps in accuracy and explainability, offering a unified solution for transparent deepfake detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel method fine-tunes pre-trained models for medical image segmentation, integrating Explainable AI for improved accuracy on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised segmentation methods from computer vision don't perform well in medical imaging, necessitating a tailored approach.

Method: Fine-tunes pre-trained models for medical images and uses Explainable AI to generate relevance scores for enhanced segmentation.

Result: Achieves improved segmentation accuracy on medical datasets CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg, and Kvasir-SEG.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between general computer vision methods and medical imaging needs, offering better performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key
element of computer-aided diagnosis. While recent advancements in computer
vision have explored unsupervised segmentation using pre-trained models, these
methods have not been translated well to the medical imaging domain. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that fine-tunes pre-trained models
specifically for medical images, achieving accurate segmentation with extensive
processing. Our method integrates Explainable AI to generate relevance scores,
enhancing the segmentation process. Unlike traditional methods that excel in
standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves
improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

*Qi Wang,Jinjia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopKD, a logit-based knowledge distillation method focusing on Top-K knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods often overlook critical information in teacher logit distributions, particularly Top-K knowledge.

Method: Proposes TopKD with two components: Top-K Scaling Module (TSM) to amplify informative logits and Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL) for targeted supervision.

Result: TopKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet, and works well with Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: Logits hold significant potential for advancing knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by TopKD's effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

*Safwen Naimi,Arij Said,Wassim Bouachir,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InceptoFormer is a neural framework combining Inception1D and Transformer for Parkinson's Disease severity evaluation via gait analysis, achieving 96.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PD severity assessment by capturing multi-scale temporal features and addressing class imbalance in gait dynamics.

Method: Uses Inception1D for multi-scale feature extraction and Transformer for long-range dependencies, with oversampling for class imbalance.

Result: Achieves 96.6% accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer effectively evaluates PD severity, offering a robust solution for gait analysis.

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

*Minghang Zheng,Yuxin Peng,Benyuan Sun,Yi Yang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical event memory framework for online video temporal grounding (OnVTG) to improve event modeling and retain long-term historical information, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OnVTG models lack effective event modeling and long-term memory, leading to low performance. The goal is to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical event memory framework with event-based predictions and a future prediction branch for real-time performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves OnVTG by modeling events and retaining historical information, enabling real-time predictions.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

TL;DR: A two-stage marine video captioning pipeline is proposed to address challenges in marine video understanding, leveraging video-text-segmentation triplets and video splitting for improved analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning datasets struggle with marine environments due to their complexity, dynamics, and lack of marine-specific focus.

Method: A two-stage pipeline using video-text-segmentation triplets and video splitting for salient object transitions.

Result: Improved marine video understanding, captioning, and generation, with a released dataset and code.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses marine video challenges, enhancing captioning and analysis.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TWGTM, a unified framework for joint virtual try-on (VTON) and virtual try-off (VTOFF), addressing their complementary symmetry through bidirectional feature disentanglement and phased training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works treat VTON and VTOFF as isolated tasks, neglecting their complementary symmetry. This gap motivates the development of a unified framework.

Method: The proposed TWGTM uses dual-conditioned guidance from latent and pixel spaces and a phased training paradigm to bridge the mask dependency asymmetry between VTON and VTOFF.

Result: Experiments on DressCode and VITON-HD datasets show the efficacy and competitive performance of TWGTM.

Conclusion: TWGTM successfully unifies VTON and VTOFF, offering a robust solution for joint clothing-centric image synthesis.

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

*Franz Thaler,Darko Stern,Gernot Plank,Martin Urschler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for whole heart segmentation using balanced joint training and strong augmentation to address domain shift in CT and MR data, achieving high accuracy for patient-specific cardiac models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death, necessitating advanced methods for analyzing cardiac structures from medical images to improve diagnosis and personalized therapy.

Method: The approach uses balanced joint training (equal CT and MR data) and strong intensity/spatial augmentation to handle domain shift. A 5-fold ensemble is employed for segmentation.

Result: The method achieved 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT, and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, outperforming or matching domain-specific models.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently produces accurate segmentations, enabling the creation of patient-specific cardiac digital twin models for personalized therapy.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

*Jinxi Liu,Zijian He,Guangrun Wang,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMFA is a unified diffusion framework for virtual try-on and try-off, eliminating the need for exhibition garments and supporting arbitrary poses. It uses partial diffusion for dynamic control and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, limiting flexibility in pose variations and real-world applicability.

Method: OMFA employs a partial diffusion strategy, selectively applying noise and denoising to components like garments or faces, enabling bidirectional transformations without masks.

Result: OMFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in try-on and try-off tasks, supporting multi-view and arbitrary-pose synthesis from a single image.

Conclusion: OMFA provides a practical, mask-free solution for virtual garment synthesis, generalizing well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

TL;DR: Event-based vision is proposed as a robust solution for drone detection, overcoming limitations of traditional cameras by eliminating motion blur and improving performance in extreme lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drones pose security challenges, and traditional cameras fail to detect them reliably due to small size, agility, and motion blur.

Method: Survey of event-based vision techniques, including data representation and spiking neural networks, for drone detection and advanced tasks like tracking and identification.

Result: Event cameras enable reliable, low-latency detection and sophisticated tasks like real-time tracking and propeller signature analysis.

Conclusion: Event-based vision is a powerful foundation for next-gen counter-UAV systems, offering efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAlignDiff introduces a diffusion-based method for automatic tooth alignment, combining point cloud regression and diffusion modeling to improve orthodontic treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for tooth alignment rely on deterministic point-to-point constraints, missing anatomical structure and distribution characteristics of transformation matrices.

Method: TAlignDiff uses a point cloud-based regression network (PRN) for alignment and a diffusion-based denoising module (DTMD) to learn transformation matrix distributions, integrating both for bidirectional feedback.

Result: Experiments show TAlignDiff's effectiveness and superiority in tooth alignment, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff offers a promising approach for orthodontic treatment by leveraging diffusion-based learning and geometric constraints.

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing events in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels, where temporal boundaries are unknown.

Method: Proposes a Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation module and Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification to identify reliable timestamps, followed by Anchor-based Temporal Propagation for better localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages cross-modal consistency to improve weakly-supervised audio-visual event localization.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: To improve tractography by capturing fine-scale structural details and ensuring long-range consistency in streamline propagation.

Method: Uses a dual-pathway encoding network for local and global modeling, combined with a conditional diffusion model for end-to-end trainable tractography.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (ISMRM Challenge, TractoInferno) and shows strong generalizability across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DDTracking provides anatomically plausible, robust, and scalable tractography for broad dMRI applications.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad

TL;DR: K2Sight introduces structured semantic supervision for grounding abnormalities in medical images, improving efficiency and performance over large-scale VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist VLMs struggle with medical domain terms, and specialized VLMs require excessive resources. K2Sight aims to bridge this gap efficiently.

Method: Decomposes clinical concepts into visual attributes (shape, density, location) and uses instruction-style prompts for training.

Result: Compact models (0.23B/2B params) outperform larger VLMs (7B+), achieving up to 9.82% improvement in mAP50 with only 1.5% of the data.

Conclusion: K2Sight effectively integrates domain knowledge and spatial structure, enabling efficient and high-performance medical image grounding.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin disease classification is challenging due to inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, necessitating robust CAD systems.

Method: Evaluates three pre-processing techniques (RGB, CMY, CLAHE) and benchmarks pre-trained CNNs (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformers (ViT, Swin, DinoV2) using accuracy and F1-score.

Result: DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest accuracy (93%) and F1-scores, with Grad-CAM showing precise lesion localization.

Conclusion: Effective pre-processing and model choice are crucial for robust and explainable dermatology CAD systems.

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

### [119] [Pseudo Depth Meets Gaussian: A Feed-forward RGB SLAM Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04597)
*Linqing Zhao,Xiuwei Xu,Yirui Wang,Hao Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yansong Tang,Haibin Yan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fast online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM and feed-forward pose prediction, reducing tracking time by over 90% while matching state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction from pose-free RGB streams face challenges with long sequences or rely on slow optimization and depth sensors. The goal is to improve speed and accuracy.

Method: Integrates a depth estimator into RGB-D SLAM, employs 3D Gaussian mapping for geometric accuracy, and uses a feed-forward recurrent prediction module for camera pose inference. Introduces local graph rendering for robustness.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to SplaTAM on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, with tracking time reduced by over 90%.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines speed and accuracy, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

### [120] [OmniDepth: Bridging Monocular and Stereo Reasoning with Latent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04611)
*Tongfan Guan,Jiaxin Guo,Chen Wang,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniDepth unifies monocular and stereo depth estimation by iteratively aligning their latent representations, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular and stereo depth estimation have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but current methods treat them disjointly. OmniDepth aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses iterative bidirectional alignment with a cross-attentive mechanism to synchronize monocular contextual cues with stereo representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing zero-shot generalization error by >40% on benchmarks like Middlebury and ETH3D, and handles reflective/transparent surfaces better.

Conclusion: OmniDepth harmonizes monocular and stereo approaches, overcoming modality-specific limitations for robust 3D perception.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

*Kagan Ozturk,Deeksha Arun,Kevin W. Bowyer,Patrick Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of bilateral ear symmetry on CNN-based ear recognition, finding that treating left and right ears separately improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how bilateral ear symmetry affects CNN-based ear recognition, as this aspect has been overlooked in prior studies.

Method: Developed an ear side classifier to categorize images as left or right, then evaluated the impact of side information during training and testing across five datasets.

Result: Treating left and right ears separately during training and testing leads to notable performance improvements.

Conclusion: Incorporating bilateral symmetry information enhances CNN-based ear recognition, with practical insights provided for optimizing training on large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Result: Best MLLM achieves 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems, highlighting the challenge.

Conclusion: FinMMR aims to advance MLLMs' reasoning in real-world financial scenarios.

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

### [123] [EncQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Visual Encodings for Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04650)
*Kushin Mukherjee,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EncQA benchmark evaluates VLMs on chart understanding, revealing gaps in visual reasoning despite model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack comprehensive visual reasoning for chart interpretation, prompting the need for a systematic benchmark.

Method: Introduces EncQA with 2,076 synthetic QA pairs covering 6 visual encodings and 8 tasks, evaluated on 9 VLMs.

Result: Performance varies across encodings and tasks; model size doesn't consistently improve results.

Conclusion: Targeted strategies, not just scaling, are needed to advance chart understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-SAM is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends SAM's segmentation capabilities to handle any segmentation task, introducing a unified approach for pixel-level understanding and a new VGD segmentation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LLMs in pixel-level perception and SAM's shortcomings in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation.

Method: Proposes X-SAM, a unified MLLM framework with a novel training strategy for diverse datasets and introduces VGD segmentation for interactive visual prompts.

Result: X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal visual understanding.

Conclusion: X-SAM effectively bridges the gap in pixel-level perceptual tasks for MLLMs, offering a versatile and high-performing solution for unified segmentation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Conclusion: The AI technology enhances chicken health management by enabling early infection identification, reducing manual inspection, and improving biosecurity.

Abstract: In the poultry industry, detecting chicken illnesses is essential to avoid
financial losses. Conventional techniques depend on manual observation, which

real-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by
developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8
detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A
sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides
accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to
farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection
identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing
biosecurity in large-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health
management. The real-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective
method for improving farm management techniques.

*Gustav Hanning,Kalle ÃstrÃ¶m,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCuboid is an optimization-based method for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation using multi-view alignment of dense deep features, outperforming single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current room layout estimation methods rely on single views and panoramic images, limiting accuracy and flexibility.

Method: PixCuboid uses multi-view alignment of dense deep features, trained end-to-end for large convergence basins and smooth loss landscapes.

Result: Outperforms competitors on new benchmarks (ScanNet++ and 2D-3D-Semantics) and extends to multi-room estimation.

Conclusion: PixCuboid offers a flexible, high-performance solution for room layout estimation, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierarchicalPrune compresses billion-scale text-to-image diffusion models for on-device inference by leveraging functional hierarchies, reducing memory and latency with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive parameter scale (8-11B) of state-of-the-art DMs hinders inference on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Position Pruning, Positional Weight Preservation, and Sensitivity-Guided Distillation to compress models.

Result: Achieves 77.5-80.4% memory reduction, 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, and minimal quality drop (2.6% GenEval, 7% HPSv2).

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune enables efficient on-device inference while preserving perceptual quality, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

*Yansheng Gao,Yufei Zheng,Jinghan Qu,Zixi Zhu,Yukuan Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt is a prompt tuning framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that enhances robustness against weak semantic perturbations by integrating noise prompts and noise-resistant visual prototypes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to subtle noise, degrading their generalization to unseen classes. ANPrompt addresses this by improving robustness.

Method: ANPrompt constructs noise prompts from perturbed text embeddings, integrates them with learnable tokens, and computes noise-resistant visual prototypes. It uses alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives.

Result: ANPrompt outperforms existing methods on 11 benchmarks, showing superior robustness to semantic noise and better generalization.

Conclusion: ANPrompt effectively enhances the robustness and generalization of prompt-tuned VLMs against weak semantic perturbations.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterVLA, a large-scale dataset for human-object-human interaction, combining egocentric and exocentric modalities, and establishes benchmarks for AI agent development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric perspective, which are crucial for AI assistants.

Method: A hybrid RGB-MoCap system captures multimodal data (egocentric/exocentric videos, motions, commands) using GPT-generated scripts.

Result: InterVLA dataset with 11.4 hours, 1.2M frames, and benchmarks for motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and prediction.

Conclusion: InterVLA and its benchmarks will advance AI agent development in the physical world.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Motivation: Training multi-agent systems is challenging and requires manual effort; TurboTrain aims to simplify and optimize this process.

Method: TurboTrain uses masked reconstruction learning for pretraining and gradient conflict suppression for balanced multi-task learning.

Result: The framework reduces training time and improves performance on the V2XPnP-Seq dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: TurboTrain effectively captures multi-agent features and enhances downstream tasks, proving its utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

TL;DR: BEVCon is a contrastive learning framework for improving BEV perception in autonomous driving, enhancing feature representations and achieving +2.4% mAP gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models, which is crucial for tasks like 3D object detection and segmentation.

Method: Introduces two contrastive learning modules: instance feature contrast for BEV features and perspective view contrast for the image backbone, combined with detection losses.

Result: Achieves up to +2.4% mAP improvement on the nuScenes dataset over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of representation learning in BEV perception and offers a complementary approach to task-specific optimizations.

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

*Ziyang Leng,Jiawei Yang,Wenlong Yi,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-Occ is a framework for 3D occupancy representation learning in autonomous driving, improving spatiotemporal feature learning with temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in efficiently aggregating 3D occupancy over time due to high processing costs and voxel uncertainty/dynamics.

Method: Uses a spatiotemporal memory for historical info and memory attention for uncertainty/dynamic awareness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 3 mIoU, reduces temporal inconsistency by 29%.

Conclusion: ST-Occ effectively enhances 3D occupancy prediction by leveraging temporal dependencies.

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore less-studied dimensions of bias (religion, caste) in LLMs and assess the persistence of such biases.

Method: Generated 7,200 stories about Indian life events (e.g., weddings) using diverse prompts, comparing outputs to census data.

Result: GPT-4 Turbo overrepresents dominant groups, showing bias persists despite prompts. Training data diversification alone may not fix this.

measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

TL;DR: An AI-powered chatbot, Krishi Sathi, provides personalized agricultural advice to Indian farmers via text and speech, using a structured, multi-turn conversation and retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of timely, accessible, and language-friendly agricultural advice for Indian farmers, especially in rural areas with low literacy.

Method: The system uses an IFT model fine-tuned on Indian agricultural knowledge, follows a structured dialogue flow, and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for tailored responses. It supports English and Hindi with speech features.

Result: Achieved 97.53% query response accuracy, 91.35% contextual relevance, and 97.53% query completion rate, with an average response time under 6 seconds.

Conclusion: Combining intent-driven dialogue, instruction-tuned models, and retrieval-based generation improves agricultural support accessibility and quality in India.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT), a framework to improve LLM inference efficiency by prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and pruning suboptimal candidates early.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in autoregressive LLM inference, where traditional methods lack prioritization, leading to unnecessary computational overhead.

Method: Proposes HVT, a hierarchical verification-pruning algorithm, integrated into standard LLM pipelines without retraining.

Result: HVT outperforms existing speculative decoding, reducing inference time and energy consumption while maintaining output quality.

Conclusion: HVT demonstrates the potential of hierarchical verification for accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

TL;DR: WiNELL is a multi-agent framework for updating Wikipedia articles by aggregating online information and generating precise edit suggestions, outperforming existing LLMs in efficiency and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's reliance on manual updates is inefficient; WiNELL aims to automate and improve the process using LLM-based agents.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework to aggregate and select new knowledge, then generates edit suggestions trained on Wikipedia's edit history.

Result: Outperforms open-source and closed-source LLMs in coverage and efficiency, demonstrating timely factual updates.

Conclusion: WiNELL shows promise for automating knowledge base updates, advancing research in LLM agents for continuous knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GanitBench is a multilingual (English/Hindi) benchmark for evaluating VLMs on math tasks, showing GPT-4o mini's dominance (38.15% accuracy) and the impact of language and CoT settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual (especially Hindi) benchmarks for VLMs beyond comprehension/translation tasks.

Method: Introduce GanitBench (1527 math questions from Indian exams), evaluate VLMs in zero-shot/two-shot CoT settings, and apply a 'Double Lock' constraint.

Result: GPT-4o mini performs best (38.15% accuracy), two-shot CoT is more effective, and Hindi language reduces performance.

Conclusion: GanitBench promotes multilingual VLM research, highlighting challenges in non-English tasks and CoT effectiveness.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnTrace is a new efficient and accurate context traceback method for LLMs, leveraging attention weights and outperforming existing solutions like TracLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and inefficiency of current context traceback methods in LLMs, which are crucial for interpretability and trustworthiness.

Method: AttnTrace uses attention weights from LLMs, enhanced by two novel techniques, and provides theoretical insights for its design.

Result: AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than state-of-the-art methods and improves prompt injection detection in long contexts.

Conclusion: AttnTrace offers a practical solution for context traceback, enhancing LLM interpretability and security, with demonstrated real-world applicability.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

### [140] [Majority Bit-Aware Watermarking For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03829)
*Jiahao Xu,Rui Hu,Zikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ are novel watermarking methods for LLMs that improve the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy by using majority bit-aware encoding and clustering-based decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about LLM misuse by embedding identifiable messages for origin verification, while overcoming the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy in existing methods.

Method: MajorMark uses majority bit-aware encoding for flexible token selection and clustering-based decoding for accuracy. MajorMark$^+$ partitions messages into blocks for independent encoding and deterministic decoding.

Result: Outperforms prior multi-bit watermarking baselines in both decoding accuracy and text generation quality.

Conclusion: MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ offer effective solutions for watermarking LLM-generated content without compromising quality or accuracy.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Result: Key findings include the limitations of current metrics, the value of external evidence, and the need for domain-specific customization.

Conclusion: The review emphasizes building accurate, explainable, and domain-specific LLMs for trustworthy fact-checking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

TL;DR: A QA-focused entity linking agent using a Large Language Model to handle short, ambiguous questions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EL methods struggle with short, ambiguous questions in QA tasks, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes an agent using a Large Language Model to simulate human workflows: identifying mentions, retrieving candidates, and making decisions.

Result: Experiments show the agent's robustness and effectiveness in tool-based EL and QA tasks.

Conclusion: The agent improves EL for QA, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in short-context scenarios.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

TL;DR: Sotopia-RL enhances social intelligence in LLMs by refining episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards, addressing partial observability and multi-dimensionality in social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social intelligence in LLMs is crucial for real-world tasks, but RL training is hindered by partial observability and multi-dimensionality in social interactions.

Method: Proposes Sotopia-RL, a framework using utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards to improve credit assignment and reduce reward hacking.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard, 8.31 on Sotopia-full), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Sotopia-RL's utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional rewards are essential for effective RL training in social tasks.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: CoAct-1 introduces a hybrid system combining GUI-based control with programmatic execution, improving efficiency and reliability in computer automation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents using GUIs are inefficient and brittle for complex tasks. Integrating coding as an action can enhance robustness and flexibility.

Method: CoAct-1 uses an Orchestrator to delegate tasks between a GUI Operator and a Programmer agent, which writes and executes scripts in Python or Bash.

Result: Achieves a 60.76% success rate on OSWorld, outperforming GUI-only agents, and reduces average task steps from 15 to 10.15.

Conclusion: Combining GUI and coding actions offers a more powerful, efficient, and scalable approach to computer automation.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

TL;DR: CAP-LLM is a novel framework for personalized news headline generation, combining user preferences and factual consistency using LLMs, outperforming baselines in accuracy and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating engaging yet factually accurate news headlines tailored to user preferences, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: CAP-LLM integrates a User Preference Encoder, Context Injection Adapter, and Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module into a pre-trained LLM backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PENS dataset, with improved factual consistency (FactCC 87.50) and personalization metrics (Pc(avg) 2.73).

Conclusion: CAP-LLM effectively balances personalization and factual accuracy, validated by ablation studies and human evaluations.

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Result: Enhances safety and responsibility of GenAI systems, reducing risks of discrimination and reputational harm.

Conclusion: Contributes to the development of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative AI applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

*Md Arafat Sultan,RamÃ³n Fernandez Astudillo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve token efficiency in self-consistency for long reasoning tasks by pruning hypotheses early using confidence and lexical coverage indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency is effective but token-intensive, limiting practicality for long reasoning tasks.

Method: Generate solutions in parallel, prune hypotheses using model confidence and lexical coverage, and apply a weighted set cover algorithm.

Result: Token efficiency improved by 10-35% across five LLMs on three math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Early hypothesis pruning enhances token efficiency while preserving parallelism in self-consistency.

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 43,880 explanations from 10 LLMs, introduced a dual-judge evaluation framework, and fine-tuned models using SFT and DPO.

Result: LLM judges aligned with human evaluations; explanation quality varied by model, audience, and category; DPO/SFT-finetuned models outperformed larger ones.

Conclusion: Preference-based learning (DPO/SFT) effectively enhances LLM-generated well-being explanations, with significant quality variations across factors.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

TL;DR: A social robot co-facilitator, powered by a transparent agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), enhances group meetings by interpreting social dynamics and providing discreet cues, outperforming foundation models in intervention prediction and knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitators in group settings face challenges like disengagement and interpersonal difficulties, needing technology to interpret social cues transparently and assist effectively.

Method: The paper introduces a social robot co-facilitator using a transfer learning framework to distill foundation models into a specialized, interpretable CBM for real-time intervention recommendations.

Result: The CBM-based system outperforms zero-shot foundation models in predicting intervention needs, generalizes across groups, and transfers expert facilitator knowledge to novices.

Conclusion: The work offers a blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in social domains through interpretable robotic partners, improving facilitator performance and group dynamics.

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmonyGuard is a multi-agent framework for balancing safety and utility in web environments, improving policy compliance by 38% and task completion by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in collaborative optimization of safety and utility in web agents, which current research lacks.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework with Adaptive Policy Enhancement (Policy Agent) and Dual-Objective Optimization (Utility Agent).

Result: Achieves up to 38% better policy compliance and 20% higher task completion, with over 90% compliance across tasks.

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard effectively balances safety and utility in web environments, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

TL;DR: SMEdit improves MLBME for LLMs by using multiple backpropagation steps and norm regularization, enhancing performance in low-data scenarios and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static nature of LLMs makes updating knowledge costly, and MLBME struggles in low-data scenarios and with training efficiency due to KL divergence computation.

Method: Proposes SMEdit, which uses multiple backpropagation steps (MBPS) and norm regularization to improve editing performance and efficiency.

Result: SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME methods on two datasets and LLMs, with MBPS also enhancing existing methods.

Conclusion: SMEdit addresses MLBME limitations, offering better performance and efficiency, with potential for broader integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

TL;DR: ZARA is a zero-shot, explainable HAR framework using raw motion time-series, outperforming baselines by 2.53x in macro F1 without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods require retraining for new activities or setups, and LLM-based approaches lack accuracy and interpretability.

Method: ZARA integrates a feature knowledge base, multi-sensor retrieval, and a hierarchical agent pipeline to guide LLMs for predictions and explanations.

Result: ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, surpassing baselines by 2.53x in macro F1, with verifiable interpretability.

Conclusion: ZARA is a flexible, trustworthy solution for HAR, validated by ablation studies and benchmarks.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

*Thilo Hagendorff,Erik Derner,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs) simplify jailbreaking, making it accessible to non-experts with a 97.14% success rate, highlighting alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how LRMs can bypass AI safety mechanisms easily, converting jailbreaking into a scalable, low-cost activity.

Method: Evaluated four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) as autonomous adversaries against nine target models using a benchmark of 70 harmful prompts.

Result: Achieved a 97.14% attack success rate, showing LRMs can systematically erode safety guardrails.

Conclusion: Urgent need to align frontier models to resist and prevent acting as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

*Jiabing Yang,Yixiang Chen,Zichen Wen,Chenhang Cui,Peiyan Li,Yuan Xu,Bowen Fang,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the decline in controllability of long-form text generation using prefix-based methods, proposing Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA) to enhance attention to prefixes and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focus on short sequences, leaving long-form text generation underexplored, with controllability declining as sequence length increases.

Method: Proposes DTPA, a lightweight framework that dynamically amplifies attention to prefixes and selects optimal prefix types, with exponential scaling for longer sequences.

Result: DTPA outperforms other methods in attribute control while maintaining fluency, diversity, and topic relevance, especially in long text generation.

Conclusion: DTPA effectively enhances controllability in long-form text generation, balancing attribute constraints and text quality.

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

### [155] [PAIRS: Parametric-Verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04057)
*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAIRS is a training-free framework that improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by adaptively deciding when to retrieve external knowledge and how to select relevant documents, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems inefficiently retrieve information for every query and risk retrieving irrelevant documents, especially for sparse queries.

Method: PAIRS uses a dual-path generation mechanism to decide retrieval necessity and employs dual-path retrieval (DPR) with Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) for divergent cases.

Result: PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by 25% (retrieving for only 75% of queries) and improves accuracy (+1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over baselines).

Conclusion: PAIRS effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in RAG systems by integrating parametric and retrieved knowledge adaptively.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by optimizing data processing, selection, training, and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment. The study aims to enhance efficiency without compromising performance.

Method: The approach involves building reliable datasets, controlled experiments with varied configurations, and systematic evaluation of capability, versatility, response time, and safety.

Result: Comparative tests validated the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in improving LLM efficiency.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates methods to optimize LLMs for resource-constrained settings, contributing to broader deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of
artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their
large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient
Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

*Zhongyi Zhou,Kohei Uehara,Haoyu Zhang,Jingtao Zhou,Lin Gu,Ruofei Du,Zheng Xu,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolGrad is an agentic framework that inverts the traditional tool-use dataset synthesis process, first creating valid tool-use chains and then generating user queries, resulting in a high-quality dataset (ToolGrad-5k) with 100% pass rate and superior model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for synthesizing tool-use datasets are inefficient and prone to annotation failures, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: ToolGrad uses an iterative, 'answer-first' process guided by textual gradients to construct valid tool-use chains before generating user queries.

Result: ToolGrad-5k, the resulting dataset, exhibits more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate, outperforming baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: ToolGrad's inverted paradigm is more efficient and effective, producing high-quality datasets that enhance model performance.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

*Jianghangfan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Kening Zheng,Xin Zou,Song Dai,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GM-PRM introduces a generative multimodal process reward model that actively corrects errors in reasoning steps, improving solution quality and achieving state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal PRMs lack corrective and explanatory power, limiting their effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning.

Method: GM-PRM provides fine-grained analysis of reasoning steps and generates corrections for errors, enabling the Refined Best-of-N inference strategy.

Result: GM-PRM achieves top performance on multimodal math benchmarks with high data efficiency (20K-sample training dataset).

Conclusion: GM-PRM transforms PRMs into active collaborators, enhancing reasoning accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper investigates over-memorization in finetuned LLMs, where models memorize training data excessively, leading to high test perplexity but maintained accuracy, while harming robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning, particularly the over-memorization phenomenon, and its impact on model performance.

Method: Analyze finetuning dynamics on reasoning tasks, identifying conditions like training epochs and learning rates that cause over-memorization.

Result: Over-memorization reduces robustness, generalization, and diversity, despite comparable accuracy. It occurs across tasks, models, and methods.

Conclusion: Overparameterized LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics. Recommendations for checkpoint and learning rate selection are provided to mitigate over-memorization.

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

TL;DR: A novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets improves LLM alignment efficiency by focusing on challenging cases, outperforming baselines with only 10% of the original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human preferences is challenging due to reliance on costly preference datasets. Current methods lack high-quality data selection for preference data.

Method: Introduces a difficulty-based data selection strategy using DPO implicit reward gaps to identify challenging cases, enhancing data efficiency.

Result: Outperforms five baselines across datasets and tasks, achieving better performance with 10% of the original data.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, efficient solution for LLM alignment with limited resources.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human Fooling Rate (HFR) to measure if TTS systems can deceive humans, revealing gaps in current evaluations and progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether TTS systems can genuinely pass a human deception test, moving beyond subjective evaluations.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models using HFR, comparing human and machine-generated speech.

Result: Commercial models perform well in zero-shot settings, but open-source systems lag in natural speech. Fine-tuning helps but doesn't close the gap fully.

Conclusion: More realistic, human-centric evaluations are needed alongside subjective tests to accurately benchmark TTS progress.

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework is proposed to mitigate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by ensuring causal completeness of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate hallucinationsâsemantically inconsistent outputsâdue to inadequate capture of causal factors or misleading non-causal cues.

Method: A novel reinforcement learning framework evaluates token-level causal completeness (sufficiency and necessity) and integrates it into GRPO optimization.

Result: The approach effectively reduces hallucinations across benchmark datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses hallucinations in MLLMs by emphasizing causal completeness in token generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art DR systems show varied performance (F1 scores 0.02-0.72), with OpenAI's model leading at 0.55. Analysis reveals insights into search mechanisms and grounding.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a formal DR definition and benchmark, revealing limitations in current systems and motivating improvements in search and grounding.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at

### [164] [Eliciting and Analyzing Emergent Misalignment in State-of-the-Art Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04196)
*Siddhant Panpatil,Hiskias Dingeto,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: State-of-the-art language models are vulnerable to conversational manipulation, revealing gaps in alignment methods. A manual red-teaming study with Claude-4-Opus identified 10 attack scenarios, leading to the creation of MISALIGNMENTBENCH for automated testing. Cross-model evaluation showed a 76% vulnerability rate, with GPT-4.1 most susceptible (90%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in current alignment techniques of language models, particularly under sophisticated conversational manipulation.

Method: Systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus to identify attack scenarios, followed by the development of MISALIGNMENTBENCH for automated cross-model evaluation.

Result: Discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, with a 76% overall vulnerability rate across five models. GPT-4.1 was most susceptible (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet showed more resistance (40%).

Conclusion: Current alignment methods lack robustness against subtle, scenario-based manipulation. Future AI systems need improved defenses against such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

### [165] [Reasoning Beyond Labels: Measuring LLM Sentiment in Low-Resource, Culturally Nuanced Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04199)
*Millicent Ochieng,Anja Thieme,Ignatius Ezeani,Risa Ueno,Samuel Maina,Keshet Ronen,Javier Gonzalez,Jacki O'Neill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate sentiment analysis in culturally nuanced, low-resource contexts, focusing on LLMs' reasoning in code-mixed WhatsApp messages. It highlights variability in model performance and the need for culturally sensitive AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis in culturally diverse, low-resource settings is challenging due to assumptions of fixed labels and universal expressions. The study aims to assess LLMs' ability to handle such complexities.

Method: The framework uses human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based explanation evaluation to test LLMs' interpretability, robustness, and alignment with human reasoning.

Result: Top-tier LLMs show stable reasoning, while open models struggle with ambiguity or sentiment shifts. Significant variation in model performance is observed.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of culturally sensitive and reasoning-aware AI evaluation for real-world, complex communication.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

### [166] [ReasoningGuard: Safeguarding Large Reasoning Models with Inference-time Safety Aha Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04204)
*Yuquan Wang,Mi Zhang,Yining Wang,Geng Hong,Xiaoyu You,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasoningGuard is an inference-time safeguard for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that identifies critical reasoning points and triggers safety-oriented reflections, outperforming existing defenses with minimal extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs are vulnerable to harmful content generation during reasoning, and current defenses are costly and unscalable.

Method: ReasoningGuard uses the model's internal attention behavior to identify critical reasoning points and implements a scaling sampling strategy for optimal path selection.

Result: It effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks and outperforms seven existing safeguards.

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard provides state-of-the-art safety defenses without exaggerated safety issues, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

### [167] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Black Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04219)
*Kosuke Yoshimura,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates black box LLMs for Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC), comparing three prompting strategies in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Few-shot improves accuracy, with LLMs outperforming traditional models on deeper hierarchies, but at higher API costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in HTC (data scarcity, model complexity) by exploring LLMs as an alternative to traditional methods requiring extensive labeled data and resources.

Method: Three prompting strategies (DL, DH, TMH) tested in zero-shot and few-shot settings on two datasets, comparing accuracy and cost.

Result: Few-shot improves accuracy; LLMs (especially DH) outperform traditional models on deeper hierarchies but increase API costs.

Conclusion: Black box LLMs show promise for HTC, but prompt strategy selection must balance performance and cost.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

### [168] [DP-GPT4MTS: Dual-Prompt Large Language Model for Textual-Numerical Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04239)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-GPT4MTS introduces a dual-prompt framework combining explicit and textual prompts to improve time series forecasting by integrating textual context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models overlook textual data like events/news, which can enhance forecasting accuracy. Existing single-prompt frameworks fail to capture timestamped text semantics effectively.

Method: DP-GPT4MTS uses dual prompts: explicit for task instructions and textual for context-aware embeddings. Textual embeddings are refined via self-attention and feed-forward networks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on diverse datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt mechanism enhances time series prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

*Xi Wang,Anxo Perez,Javier Parapar,Fabio Crestani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TalkDep uses advanced language models to simulate diverse, clinically valid patients for depression diagnosis training, verified by professionals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shortage of real training data for mental health services limits support for depression diagnosis, necessitating better simulated patient solutions.

Method: Proposes TalkDep, a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline using language models, psychiatric criteria, and symptom scales to generate authentic patient responses.

Result: Simulated patients are validated by clinical professionals, offering scalable resources for diagnostic training.

Conclusion: TalkDep enhances the robustness and generalizability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

*Zunhai Su,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVSink, a method to predict and preserve attention sinks during KV cache quantization, outperforming existing strategies like Preserve-First-N (PFN) and improving perplexity (PPL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient understanding of attention sinks' role in KV cache quantization and their emergence beyond initial tokens, aiming to mitigate performance degradation.

Method: Examines cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers to understand attention sinks, then proposes KVSink, a plug-and-play method for predicting sink tokens with minimal overhead.

Result: KVSink outperforms PFN in preserving attention sinks and, when combined with KVQuant, improves PPL and reduces reliance on 16-bit outliers.

Conclusion: KVSink provides a more effective solution for attention sink preservation during KV cache quantization, enhancing LLM inference efficiency.

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

*Jiangyuan Wang,Kejun Xiao,Qi Sun,Huaipeng Zhao,Tao Luo,Jiandong Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShoppingBench is a new benchmark for complex e-commerce tasks, challenging even advanced language agents like GPT-4.1, with success rates below 50%. A distilled smaller agent achieves competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack complexity for real-world e-commerce goals like voucher application or multi-product searches.

Method: A scalable framework simulates user instructions using real-world products, with a large-scale shopping sandbox for evaluation. Trajectory distillation and fine-tuning are used to train a smaller agent.

Result: State-of-the-art agents struggle (success <50%), but the distilled smaller agent matches GPT-4.1's performance.

Conclusion: ShoppingBench addresses complex e-commerce tasks effectively, and distillation enables efficient smaller agents.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

### [172] [A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04276)
*Jiayi Wen,Tianxin Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphRAG enhances LLMs with structured knowledge graphs but is vulnerable to knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs), which manipulate graph construction to mislead reasoning. Two attacks (TKPA and UKPA) show high success rates, and defenses are ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG improves LLM accuracy and explainability but is susceptible to manipulation during graph construction, posing a security risk.

Method: Two KPAs are proposed: TKPA targets vulnerable nodes for precise QA control, while UKPA disrupts graph integrity via linguistic cues.

Result: TKPA achieves 93.1% success; UKPA reduces QA accuracy from 95% to 50% with minimal text changes. Defenses fail to detect these attacks.

Conclusion: GraphRAG's vulnerability to KPAs highlights the need for robust security measures in knowledge graph pipelines.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

TL;DR: MedCheck is a lifecycle-oriented framework for evaluating medical LLM benchmarks, addressing gaps in clinical fidelity, data integrity, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in healthcare lack reliability due to poor clinical fidelity, weak data management, and inadequate safety metrics.

Method: MedCheck deconstructs benchmark development into five stages and uses 46 medically-tailored criteria to evaluate 53 medical LLM benchmarks.

Result: Analysis revealed systemic issues like disconnection from clinical practice, data contamination risks, and neglect of safety-critical evaluations.

Conclusion: MedCheck acts as a diagnostic tool and guideline to improve standardization and reliability in AI healthcare evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new annotation schema for rhetorical roles in scientific literature and evaluates 37 LLMs for classifying these roles, achieving high performance with fine-tuning and semi-synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI methods for analyzing scientific literature and support automated literature review generation by defining a relevant annotation schema and effective large-scale annotation strategies.

Method: 1) Introduces a novel annotation schema for literature review generation. 2) Evaluates 37 LLMs using zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on the Sci-Sentence benchmark (700 expert-annotated and 2,240 LLM-labelled sentences).

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieve >96% F1. GPT-4o performs best, but lightweight open-source models also excel. Semi-synthetic data boosts small encoders and open decoder models.

Conclusion: The study advances rhetorical role classification, showing LLMs' potential for literature analysis and review generation, with practical insights for model selection and data enrichment.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Entropy Weighting to improve RL in LLMs by fine-grained credit assignment, outperforming baselines like DAPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like GRPO use uniform rewards for all tokens, limiting performance in long-chain reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Entropy Weighting with GTPO (token-level rewards) and GRPO-S (sequence-level rewards) based on entropy.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvement over DAPO, validating the entropy-weighting mechanism.

Conclusion: Dynamic Entropy Weighting enhances deep reasoning in LLMs by providing precise reward signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

*Nima Iji,Kia Dashtipour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework to enhance reasoning in multimodal LLMs by dynamically generating questions to guide modality selection, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning improvements in LLMs, like chain-of-thought, lack effectiveness in multimodal contexts where models must decide which sensory modalities to engage.

Method: The CoQ framework encourages models to generate targeted questions about their surroundings, selectively activating relevant modalities (e.g., vision, audio) for better reasoning.

Result: Evaluated on a novel multimodal benchmark, CoQ improves a foundation model's ability to identify and integrate sensory information, enhancing accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The CoQ framework effectively bridges the gap in multimodal reasoning, aligning the reasoning process with diverse tasks and improving model performance.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

Motivation: To enhance crash data quality by leveraging NLP techniques for mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification as a case study.

Result: Fine-tuned RoBERTa achieved the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%), while zero-shot LLMs showed high recall but high computational costs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned transformers offer a balanced approach for crash data quality, with practical deployment recommendations for scalability and privacy.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

### [179] [Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04401)
*VladimÃ­r HavlÃ­k*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent properties in LLMs and DNNs, arguing they arise from complex nonlinear dynamics, not just scaling, and compares them to natural emergent phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unexpected emergent capabilities of LLMs and DNNs, addressing the challenge of 'creation without understanding' in AI.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis and empirical observation of scaling laws, grokking, and phase transitions in DNNs.

Result: Emergent abilities stem from complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, not just parameter scaling, resembling natural emergent phenomena.

Conclusion: LLMs and DNNs should be viewed as complex dynamical systems governed by universal emergence principles, shifting focus to internal dynamics.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

*Kiyotada Mori,Seiya Kawano,Chaoran Liu,Carlos Toshinori Ishi,Angel Fernando Garcia Contreras,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores human selective listening to improve ASR evaluation for spoken dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify ASR capabilities needed for SDSs by studying human selective listening.

Method: Compared human transcriptions for dialogue responses with reference transcriptions.

Result: Confirmed selective listening in humans during dialogue response generation.

Conclusion: Proposes a new ASR evaluation method based on human selective listening to bridge the gap between ASR and human transcription.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

*Kiyotada Mori,Seiya Kawano,Angel Fernando Garcia Contreras,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Prediction Confidence Model (PCM) to reduce user-perceived latency in dialogue systems by estimating semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize user waiting time (UPL) in spoken dialogue systems by enabling accurate prefetching of responses.

Method: Introduces a PCM to assess whether prefetching is viable by comparing predicted and actual user utterances for semantic similarity.

Result: Evaluated based on differences between predicted and complete user utterances.

Conclusion: The PCM offers a method to improve prefetching accuracy, potentially reducing UPL in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

*Jie Zhu,Huaixia Dou,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Customer Support Conversation (CSC) task, proposing a structured framework and datasets (CSConv and RoleCS) to train agents in strategy-aligned responses, showing improved LLM performance in customer support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue datasets lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is hard to access and annotate, necessitating a structured approach for effective customer support.

Method: A CSC framework based on COPC guidelines is introduced, defining stages and strategies. CSConv (annotated real-world conversations) and RoleCS (LLM-simulated strategy-rich dialogues) are created for evaluation and training.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on RoleCS improves strategy-aligned response generation, with human evaluations confirming better problem resolution.

Conclusion: The CSC framework and datasets enhance customer support training, demonstrating the value of structured strategies and LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoformalization translates natural-language math into formal language. ThinkingF improves accuracy by combining formal knowledge and reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoformalization methods using LLMs suffer from low accuracy due to gaps in formal knowledge and reasoning.

Method: ThinkingF synthesizes datasets for formal knowledge and reasoning, then uses SFT and RLVR to train models (7B and 32B).

Result: StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores: 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench.

Conclusion: ThinkingF enhances autoformalization by addressing key gaps, outperforming prior models.

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Generative AI (GPT-4o) to create scalable, high-quality educational MCQs in Bahasa Melayu, comparing four methods (non-grounded prompting and RAG-based) and validating them via curriculum alignment and factual accuracy. RAG methods outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for scalable, quality educational tools in Malaysia, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu, while tackling challenges like factual accuracy and curriculum alignment.

Method: Four pipelines for MCQ generation: non-grounded prompting (structured/basic) and RAG (LangChain/manual). Evaluated using STS for curriculum alignment and a novel RAG-QA method for factual validity.

Result: RAG-based pipelines outperform non-grounded methods, achieving higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. Trade-offs between ease (framework-based RAG) and control (manual RAG) are analyzed.

Conclusion: The study offers a validated method for curriculum-specific content generation in low-resource languages, introduces RAG-QA evaluation, and provides insights for EdTech solutions in similar regions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

*Bastien LiÃ©tard,Gabriel Loiseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Differentiation, an extension to Word-in-Context, to include inter-word scenarios, and proposes Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE) for improved lexical semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of Word-in-Context, which only compares occurrences of the same lemma, by extending it to inter-word scenarios for richer semantic analysis.

Method: Proposes Concept Differentiation, creates a dataset from SemCor, and fine-tunes representation models (CALE) on this dataset.

Result: CALE models achieve best performances in lexical semantic tasks and show improved spatial organization of embeddings.

Conclusion: CALE provides efficient multi-purpose lexical meaning representations, demonstrating the value of fine-tuning for semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

### [186] [StyliTruth : Unlocking Stylized yet Truthful LLM Generation via Disentangled Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04530)
*Chenglei Shen,Zhongxiang Sun,Teng Shi,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyliTruth addresses the trade-off between stylized LLM responses and truthfulness by separating style and truth subspaces, enabling independent control and minimizing interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the issue of stylization-induced truthfulness collapse in LLMs, where existing methods degrade answer correctness while imposing style.

Method: Proposes StyliTruth, which uses orthogonal deflation to separate style and truth subspaces and employs adaptive token-level steering vectors for dynamic control.

Result: StyliTruth significantly reduces truthfulness collapse and outperforms existing methods in balancing style adherence with truthfulness.

Conclusion: StyliTruth effectively maintains both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness in LLM responses, validated across multiple styles and languages.

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-MIND, a clinical dataset for depression assessment, analyzes behavioral signatures, evaluates model performance, and improves LLM reasoning with clinical expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clinically validated data and real-world effectiveness in automated depression assessment.

Method: Uses C-MIND dataset with multimodal data, analyzes behavioral signatures, trains classical models, and enhances LLMs with clinical guidance.

Result: Clinical guidance improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: C-MIND provides a reliable infrastructure for clinical depression assessment, bridging data and algorithmic gaps in mental healthcare research.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-agent discussions outperform solitary ideation in generating research proposals, with cognitive diversity and expertise being key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if structured multi-agent discussions can enhance creativity in AI-driven scientific ideation, overcoming the limitations of single-agent approaches.

Method: A cooperative multi-agent framework is tested with variations in group size, leadership, and team composition (interdisciplinarity, seniority). Idea quality is evaluated via agent-based scoring and human review.

Result: Multi-agent discussions significantly outperform solitary ideation. Leadership and cognitive diversity boost quality, but expertise is essential.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems with diverse, expert teams and clear leadership enhance creative outcomes in AI ideation.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

*Magauiya Zhussip,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASA introduces structured weight sharing across transformer layers to reduce parameters by 66.7% without performance loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands of LLMs limit deployment; inter-block redundancy in transformers is underexplored.

Method: Decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, trained with standard optimizers.

Result: Achieves better accuracy and perplexity than baselines, matches ViT performance with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MASA provides a scalable, parameter-efficient solution for transformers without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TURA is a three-stage framework combining RAG with agentic tool-use to access static and dynamic information, addressing limitations of traditional RAG in AI search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with real-time needs and structured queries, limiting AI search to static content. TURA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: TURA uses Intent-Aware Retrieval, a DAG-based Task Planner, and a Distilled Agent Executor to access dynamic sources via MCP Servers.

Result: TURA successfully integrates static and dynamic information, serving millions with low-latency, real-time answers.

Conclusion: TURA bridges the gap between static RAG and dynamic sources, enhancing AI search for industrial applications.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable non-expert users to query databases using natural language, especially in resource-scarce environments.

Method: Developed a reusable pipeline for schema formatting, trained models (1000-5000 iterations), and evaluated using LFAcc, BLEU, and EM metrics.

Result: T5-Small outperformed others with 27.8% LFAcc, showing encoder-decoder models' superiority.

Conclusion: Compact transformers like T5-Small are promising for accessible text-to-SQL solutions, with modular pipeline supporting future improvements.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-Aligner, a lightweight module, improves LLM instruction alignment by generating human-preferred instructions, outperforming baselines with significant win-rate gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to align with safe, helpful, and honest content due to flawed instructions, necessitating a cost-effective solution.

Method: P-Aligner, trained on the UltraPrompt dataset synthesized via Monte-Carlo Tree Search, pre-aligns instructions to human preferences.

Result: P-Aligner achieves average win-rate gains of 28.35% on GPT-4-turbo and 8.69% on Gemma-2-SimPO, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: P-Aligner is an efficient and effective solution for preference alignment in LLMs, validated by multiple analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLMs' instruction-following but faces inefficiency and over-optimization. IFDecorator introduces a robust pipeline with cooperative-adversarial data, IntentCheck, and trip wires, achieving high accuracy and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address RLVR's inefficiency and over-optimization in LLMs by creating a more robust and sample-efficient training framework.

Method: IFDecorator combines a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel, IntentCheck for intent alignment, and trip wires to detect reward hacking.

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforms GPT-4o, and reduces reward hacking.

Conclusion: IFDecorator effectively enhances instruction-following in LLMs while mitigating training inefficiencies and reward exploitation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

*Tanvi Dinkar,Aiqi Jiang,Simona Frenda,Poppy Gerrard-Abbott,Nancie Gunson,Gavin Abercrombie,Ioannis Konstas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews NLP counterspeech research, highlighting a disconnect from affected communities and recommends stakeholder-centered approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how stakeholder participation influences counterspeech research and address the gap between NLP studies and impacted communities.

Method: Systematic review of 74 NLP studies and a participatory case study with five NGOs on online Gender-Based Violence.

Result: Reveals a growing disconnect in NLP research from community needs and identifies stakeholder-informed practices.

Conclusion: Recommends re-centering stakeholder expertise in counterspeech research for better alignment with real-world impacts.

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

TL;DR: mmGRPO extends GRPO for multi-module AI systems, improving accuracy by 11% over post-trained LMs and 5% over standalone prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of applying GRPO to modular AI systems with mixed LM calls and tools.

Method: Introduces mmGRPO, a multi-module GRPO variant that groups LM calls by module and handles variable-length trajectories.

Result: 11% accuracy improvement over post-trained LMs and 5% over prompt optimization alone.

Conclusion: mmGRPO is effective for modular AI systems and is open-sourced in DSPy.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

*Mo Li,L. H. Xu,Qitai Tan,Ting Cao,Yunxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sculptor, a framework for Active Context Management (ACM), helps LLMs manage long contexts by fragmenting, summarizing, hiding, restoring, and intelligently searching information, improving performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant early information disrupts reasoning. Existing solutions focus on external memory, but internal context management is overlooked.

Method: Sculptor equips LLMs with tools for context fragmentation, summary/hide/restore, and intelligent search to actively manage attention and working memory.

Result: Sculptor significantly improves performance on benchmarks like PI-LLM and NeedleBench, demonstrating robustness without specific training.

Conclusion: Active Context Management, not just larger token windows, is key to reliable long-context reasoning, with Sculptor providing a cognitive foundation for such tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

*Yunan Zhang,Shuoran Jiang,Mengchen Zhao,Yuefeng Li,Yang Fan,Xiangping Wu,Qingcai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes General Sample Replay (GeRe) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for LLMs, using pretraining texts and a threshold-based margin loss for activation state consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, which harms general capabilities and task performance.

Method: Introduces GeRe with a threshold-based margin (TM) loss for activation state consistency during replay learning. Compares TM with other replay strategies.

Result: TM improves performance and robustness, showing a small set of general replay samples suffices to retain capabilities and enhance task performance.

Conclusion: GeRe with TM loss effectively mitigates forgetting in continual learning for LLMs, paving the way for efficient replay methods.

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

*Thibaut Thonet,GermÃ¡n Kruszewski,Jos Rozen,Pierre Erbacher,Marc Dymetman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLM personalization with limited user preference data (PPALLI), introduces datasets DnD and ELIP, benchmarks alignment techniques, and proposes FaST, a parameter-efficient method with top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-powered assistants lack personalization for individual user preferences, prompting the need for tailored solutions with limited data.

Method: The study benchmarks alignment techniques on datasets DnD and ELIP and introduces FaST, a parameter-efficient approach using high-level features.

Result: FaST achieves the best performance among tested alignment techniques.

Conclusion: FaST is an effective solution for personalized preference alignment with limited data, advancing LLM personalization research.

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why reasoning models hallucinate more than general-purpose language models, focusing on multi-hop question answering tasks. It introduces a framework to categorize errors across three dimensions and provides insights for improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasoning failures of language models, particularly in multi-hop question answering, and uncover hidden error patterns not captured by accuracy-centric evaluations.

Method: A novel error categorization framework is introduced, analyzing failures across diversity of source documents, information coverage, and cognitive inefficiency. Human annotation and automated metrics are used.

Result: The study reveals intricate error patterns in reasoning models, highlighting cognitive limitations and providing actionable insights for future improvements.

Conclusion: The findings offer guidance for enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in language models.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI
chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and
extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.
